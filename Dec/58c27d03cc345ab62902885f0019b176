Lewis Hamilton LONDON. — World Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton believes as many as four teams could be in contention for the titles next season with McLaren being the new dark horse. The Brit reckons his former team could become a threat now that they have ditched the Honda engines in favour of getting their power units supplied by Renault. He is also expecting improvement from Ferrari and Red Bull, so he is aware that Mercedes need to start the season on the very top of their game. “McLaren will have Renault engines, then we may see four teams fighting for the championship,” Hamilton said via BBC Sport. “Red Bull will be quicker (than this year) and Ferrari will be fast. We can’t stand still. We have to keep moving forwards.” Hamilton added that his mentality is the same as it always has been and is only interested in finishing first. — AFP.
