Fungai Lupande Senior Court Reporter A Pakistani businessman was last week acquitted on charges of defrauding Max Sports (Pvt) Ltd, a sportswear company, of over $100 000. In her ruling, Harare magistrate Ms Nomsa Sabarauta said businesspeople should always be prudent when conducting themselves and there was no evidence of the transaction. She concluded that the State failed to prove a prima facie case against the accused. The court heard that Khan and the owner of Max Sports, Sohail Oaiser, are former business partners. It was alleged that sometime in March 2015, Oaiser and Khan registered the sportswear company and Oaiser had 51 percent shares, while Khan held 49 percent. They agreed that Oaiser would inject $78 000 as capital while Khan inject $38 465. It was alleged that the money was to be used for importation of stock for resale in Zimbabwe. On August 6, 2015, it was alleged, Oaiser gave Khan $78 500 to buy sportswear in Pakistan. Khan, who was visiting Zimbabwe, acknowledged receipt of the money by signing and promised to import the goods. It was alleged that Khan failed to deliver the goods within the agreed time, prompting Oaiser to make a follow up.
