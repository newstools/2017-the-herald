Tendai Ndoro Sports Reporter Zimbabwe international Tendai Ndoro could be tracing his footsteps back to South Africa as early as the January transfer window to begin a new career path in the ABSA Premiership with Ajax Cape Town. Ndoro has had a four month stint with Saudi Arabian club Al Faisaly but is back in South Africa after making only four league appearances for his new club and with one goal to show for it. And it appears the former Orlando Pirates striker is a target of the new Urban Warriors coach Muhsin Ertugral. Ajax need to turn around their poor start to the 2017/2018 season and last week they announced they parted ways with Stanley Menzo to pave the way for the Turkish mentor who has had previous stints with the PSL side. Ertugral immediately revealed his vision for the club in the second half of the season which includes beefing up his stocks to get the competitive edge in the remainder of the campaign. “I have watched the team recently and believe that with one or two additions in critical positions, we will be able to find ourselves in a more respectable position on the log standings. “There are many talented players in the team and I believe with the right guidance, I will be able to get the best out of them. I would like to thank the Board of Ajax Cape Town for the opportunity to once again allow me to lead this great club and hope that I will be able to bring back a smile to our incredible and loyal supporters,” said Ertugral. Ajax Cape Town are currently wallowing in the relegation zone. They are second from the basement with 13 points from 14 starts.
