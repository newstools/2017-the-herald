MANCHESTER. — English Premier League soccer leaders Manchester City are close to agreeing a new long-term contract with Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, British media reported on Monday. The 26-year-old signed a six-year deal when he joined City from Vfl Wolfsburg for a club record £55 million in 2015 but his new contract could run to 2024, according to the reports. The Independent reported that De Bruyne was expected to double his current wages and earn about 200 000 pounds a week with a series of bonuses on top. City’s owners want to reward De Bruyne for his superb performances this season in their top-flight record 16-match winning league run as part of the contract extension. “I’ve no feeling to go anywhere else and enjoy being part of the project here and playing the kind of football we are playing. — Reuters.
