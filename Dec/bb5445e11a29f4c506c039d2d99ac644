PERTH. — Australia moved within six wickets of reclaiming the Ashes at the close of a rain-hit day four of the third Ashes Test cricket yesterday, with England still 127 runs short of making the hosts bat again. The tourists were 132 for four when a rain-shower brought stumps an hour early at the WACA, with Dawid Malan (28 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (14) tasked with an improbable rescue mission following their defiant 237-run stand in the first innings. Australia had declared at 662 for nine after lunch, their highest ever Ashes total at home, with captain Steve Smith finally dismissed for 239 from 399 balls. Trailing 2-0, England must cobble a draw to keep the five-test series alive to Melbourne and their hopes may rest on the weather, with more showers forecast on day five. “I think we’re in a pretty good position obviously,” Australia paceman Josh Hazlewood told local radio, after dismissing both of England’s openers. “I think we would have loved one more (wicket) today but they’ve lost the wickets at the tail pretty quickly throughout the whole series.” Even with the chance of rain interruptions, it still looked bleak for the tourists, with cracks opening up on a pitch and variable bounce likely to play a part on day five. One large fissure at the southern end of the wicket opened up to swallow England number three James Vince for 55 when a Mitchell Starc ball jagged viciously back to rip out his off-stump. “I think we try and put the rain to the back of our minds,“ Vince told reporters. ”We’ve got to have belief that we can save the series and get over the line tomorrow. “It’s going to be tough. I’m sure there’s going to be some good balls flying around out there.” — Reuters.
