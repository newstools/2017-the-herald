Sports Reporter LIFE Is Good from the Amy Bronkhorst stable was outstanding in the 1450 meters Zimbabwe Challenge in a tightly contested affair at Borrowdale Racecourse on Sunday.  Jarryd Penny had the ride on Life Is Good. Robin Bruss owns the four-year-old Var (USA) gelding bred by Northfields Stud, and now a five-time winner.

Comanche Brave and Road To Dubai completed the top four with Mathematician (60kgs) and Ashton Park (59 kgs) at the rear of the field. It was Amy Bronkhorst’s day at Borrowdale Park on Sunday when she saddled three winners on the seven race card.
