President Mnangagwa Tendai Mugabe Herald Reporter President Emmerson Mnangagwa was always loyal to his predecessor, President Robert Mugabe, and at no point sought to usurp his powers, patron of the Zimbabwe Amalgamated Churches Council, Cde Jimayi Muduvuri has said. Cde Muduvuri, who is also a Zanu-PF National Consultative Assembly member, said he had toured the provinces with the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association leadership among them Cdes Victor Matemadanda, Headman Moyo and Douglas Mahiya and received that message. “I travelled the breath and length of this country in the company of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association leadership that included Cdes Victor Matemadanda, Headman Moyo and Douglas Mahiya. “We never received any report alleging that Cde Mnangagwa was plotting against his former boss,” Cde Muduvuri said. He described President Mnangagwa as a mature leader who remained calm under fire. He said the apostolic churches were fully behind the new dispensation under the stewardship of President Mnangagwa. “We had meetings with bishops from various churches who congratulated President Mnangagwa for assuming both the leadership of Zanu-PF and State Presidency. They also hailed the Zimbabwe Defence Forces for executing Operation Restore Legacy in a peaceful manner.”
