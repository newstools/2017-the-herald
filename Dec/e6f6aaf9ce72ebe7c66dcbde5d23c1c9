LONDON. — World 100m champion Justin Gatlin, twice suspended for doping, could face another scandal after The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that members of his entourage offered to sell undercover reporters performance-enhancing drugs. The 35-year-old American sprint star has sacked coach Dennis Mitchell, according to the report, which revealed Mitchell and athletics agent Robert Wagner offered to provide false prescriptions for banned performance-enhancing substances and smuggle those drugs into the United States. The Telegraph said investigations into the actions of those connected to Gatlin are being investigated by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), set up this year by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). — AFP.
