Ninja Lipsy Sindiso Dube meanwhile Ninja Lipsy has opened on battling epilepsy and has blamed the ailment for her music career’s bumps. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that causes unprovoked, recurrent seizures. A seizure is a sudden rush of electrical activity in the brain. “I have battled this condition since primary school. I used to collapse at school and taken back home, growing up everyone would associate my condition with evil spirits. In Shona they call it ‘pfari’. Due to financial difficulties I only started to get treatment only three years ago,” she said in an emotional interview in which she dug into her soul. “My family has been very supportive ever since. They always monitor my diet and remind me to take my medication. I stay with my sister who relocated from South Africa to be with me,” said Ninja Lipsy. Lipsy added that her condition has affected her bookings. “I am not supposed to be in direct contact with lights and flash photography. I always have problems with show promoters when I request for lights to be turned off when I perform live on stage. I once had a seizure on stage and it was reported that I am on drugs yet people didn’t know what I was going through. This condition has affected my bookings which is my only source of income. Some promoters sideline me whilst others understand how I operate.” It was a touching walk through the soul of a young lady who has worked hard to climb up the ladder of musical success. Lipsy urged others with the same condition to open up. “I urge everyone suffering from the same condition to open up to the people close to them. It helps for people to know so that if you suffer from a seizure they will know how to deal with you and also know what things to do and not do with you,” she said.
