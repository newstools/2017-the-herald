The planned one-day nationwide strike will include marches and protests across the country Johannesburg. — Retailers Shoprite and Checkers are due to be hit by nationwide strikes on one of the busiest shopping days before Christmas. The South African Commercial‚ Catering and Allied Workers’ Union (Saccawu) and trade union Cosatu announced on Tuesday that 30 000 workers were planning to down tools at the supermarkets on Friday. Saccawu is part of Cosatu. Checkers is part of Shoprite Holdings. The planned one-day nationwide strike will include marches and protests across the country, said Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla. The strike was protected, Cosatu added. The workers are demanding a reversal of changes to working hours‚ the reinstatement of Sandton Checkers employees who were apparently dismissed for protesting these changes‚ safe transport for workers who work night shifts and a guaranteed number of minimum working hours for part-time workers. “The federation calls for solidarity action from other workers and shoppers on the day of the strike,” Pamla said, adding that the supermarkets were treating its workers like slaves.
