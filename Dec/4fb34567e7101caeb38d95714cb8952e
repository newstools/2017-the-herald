Mahmoud Abbas RAMALLAH. – The Palestinian presidency Thursday welcomed the UN General Assembly’s vote on a resolution regarding the legal status of the city of Jerusalem. Presidential Spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina said the decision once again reflects the international community’s position with the Palestinian people, which did not give way to being threatened or blackmailed. “This decision reaffirms once again that the just Palestinian cause enjoys the support of international community, and no decisions made by any side could change the reality, that Jerusalem is an occupied territory under international law.” He added, “We will continue our efforts at the United Nations and all international forums to put an end to this occupation and to establish our Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” Abu Rudeina said. “We thank all the countries that supported the resolution and expressed their free political will, despite all the pressure exerted on them,” and stressing their full support for international law and the right of the Palestinian people to freedom and independence. – WAFA
