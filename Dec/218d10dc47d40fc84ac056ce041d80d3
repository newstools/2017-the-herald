Alexis Sanchez LONDON. — Alexis Sanchez is free to leave Arsenal in the January transfer window – if the Gunners recieve offers in the region of £35million. Arsenal will listen to offers for Sanchez next month amid growing concerns over his commitment from players and staff. Having turned down £60million from Manchester City in the summer; the Gunners are not ruling out selling the Chile international when the transfer window reopens in January. Arsenal know they are highly unlikely to receive offers near City’s bid but are still ready to cash to avoid losing Sanchez for nothing at the end of the season. Sportsmail understands bids in-excess of £35million would tempt Arsenal into selling. It remains to be seen whether the 29-year-old will consider leaving the Emirates mid-season, with sources claiming the attacker has his heart set on joining former boss Pep Guardiola at the Etihad Stadium. — The Daily Mail
