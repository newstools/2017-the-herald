LONDON. - Ian Wright thinks the way Arsenal have handled the contract situations of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez has been “disgusting business”, and believes the latter should be sold in January as he looks “disinterested” this season. Ozil and Sanchez have been two of Arsenal’s key players over the last few seasons yet both are entering the final six months of their contracts and will be free to negotiate with European clubs from January. While Ozil has been one of Arsenal’s better performers this season, Sanchez, who came close to leaving last summer, has been below his best. Former Arsenal striker Wright said on The Debate: “It is terrible business for Arsenal, for a club that is accused of being a business to allow two players like that to run their contracts down. “Sanchez on top form is easily a £100m player. Ozil on top form is worth £70m to £80m. Arsenal are letting that go. It is disgusting business on the management side for Arsenal. “How are you going to sell players like that in January for £25m? It is like people are laughing at you. Manchester City could find £25m in the car seat or something. And you’re going to get Sanchez for that kind of money? For it to get to this point where they can be offered that kind of money . . . and why would you offer £60m when they are free in a few months?’’ – Sky Sports.
