Pep Guardiola MANCHESTER. – Pep Guardiola says he is sorry if Manchester City’s derby celebrations insulted Manchester United, but not if only Jose Mourinho took offence. United manager Mourinho had milk thrown at him outside the dressing rooms after objecting to City’s raucous reaction. “If we offended United – not just one player, not Jose – Manchester United, then I apologise,” said the Spaniard. Mourinho said the incident after City’s 2-1 win was “a question of diversity in behaviour, diversity in education”. He then concluded his Tuesday news conference by suggesting the continued focus on the incident showed a lack of respect to Bournemouth, who United played last night. The Football Association says both clubs had until yesterday to reply to a request for their observations of the incident. However, Guardiola reiterated his players’ right to celebrate a victory that took them 11 points clear of their neighbours and closest challengers at the top of the Premier League table. “We have to enjoy those moments. If the people cannot understand that then I’m sorry. We won a derby,” he said of a Premier League-record 14th consecutive win. If we were not correct than I apologise to all of Manchester United. Our intentions was not that. It was to celebrate inside the locker room.” – BBC Sport.
