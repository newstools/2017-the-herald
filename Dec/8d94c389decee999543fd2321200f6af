Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter HARARE Metropolitan Handball Association chairman Bernard Muzanenhamo has hailed Dzivaresekwa Handball club and Zengeza 2 High for their display in the Zambia Youth Tournament they took part in at the Olympic Youth Development Centre, in Lusaka over the weekend. Despite playing against the tried and tested Zambian clubs who provide the bulk of their players in the national team, the country’s two representatives still managed to grab silver medals apiece for both the girls and boys Under 14 and U-14 teams. And Muzanenhamo, whose organisation played a crucial role in facilitating the fiesta was impressed. “The way all the teams played was very much impressive. It is the teams’ first time to participate in a regional tournament and for them to then go all the way to grab silver is something to cheer about. We facilitated their participation with the help of all the authorities just to give the youngsters exposure. “We were not going to be disappointed even if the teams had lost all their matches because by letting them participate, we believe they would have achieved a lot. But for them to have them gone to the fiesta, face opponents from Zambia who are the powerhouses of handball in the region and still win something shows that we have talent in this country. As an association, we will thrive to have more teams from Harare participate in tournaments of this magnitude,” he said.
