Elita Chikwati Senior Agriculture Reporter The Meteorological Services Department has called for more vigilance and preparedness, particularly for rescue operations, as the country is expected to receive heavy rainfall in excess of 50 millimetres in 24 hours this week. The country started receiving heavy rains on Sunday. In a statement on Monday, the MSD said it was disturbing that despite the alerts and warnings, reports of drowning were quite rampant. “The presented rainy situation is a combination of the presence of a deep low pressure system centred over the country and a frontal cloud system which entered the country through Matabeleland provinces. Added to this combination is the heating around midday which further enhances rainfall activity,” said the MSD. Some of the high rainfalls received from December 21 to 24 were recorded in Bulawayo Metropolitan on December 21 and 23. The Goetz Observatory received 73mm and 48mm respectively on the two dates while Joshua Nkomo Airport received 98mm on Sunday. Harare Metropolitan received 53mm on Sunday, Wedza 52mm on December 22, Mutoko 46mm and Kariba 58mm on Sunday. Buffalo Range in Masvingo received 32mm, Mutare fire station 64mm on December 22 and Nkayi 69mm on Sunday. The highest rainfall recorded in Midlands was 32mm in Kwekwe on Sunday while West Nicholson in Matabeleland South received 25mm on Saturday. Due to these incessant heavy rains, MSD urged the public to avoid crossing flooded rivers and swollen streams where the depth is unknown. “Avoid driving on a road covered by water and even so, driving at night since flood dangers become difficult to recognise. In case of heavy rain and severe thunderstorms, if possible stay indoors and off the roads; if outdoors seek shelter immediately, but do not seek shelter under a tree or in isolated sheds. “Furthermore, the public is urged to regularly follow weather forecasts on television and radio,” said the MSD.
