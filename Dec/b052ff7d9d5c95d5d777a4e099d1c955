MANCHESTER. — Manchester United are holding off handing Jose Mourinho a new contract. Doubts are growing over whether he can take the club back to the summit of English football. United’s bosses have been left stunned by the way Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City have turned the Premier League title race into a procession with Mourinho seemingly unable to respond. And while the sight City romping clear at the top of the table is tough enough for United to take, influential boardroom members are also unhappy about the ultra-pragmatic tactical approach still being taken by the Portuguese. Questions are now being asked at a high level whether the former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss should be handed an extension on the three-year contract he signed in the summer of 2016. He has not stayed at any club he has managed for longer than three seasons. — The Mirror.
