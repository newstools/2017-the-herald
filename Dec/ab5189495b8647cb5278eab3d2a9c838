Walter Mswazie Masvingo Correspondent The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has availed $50 000 to Masvingo City Council for eight utility vehicles that are expected to help the local authority improve its service delivery. According to the latest minutes from a full council meeting recently, town treasurer Mrs Thandiwe Dube said officials had already visited Willowvale Motor Industries in Harare to start the process of acquiring the vehicles. “On the purchase of eight operational vehicles, the city treasurer Mrs Dube reported that a visit was made to Willowvale Motor Industries to present a letter regarding the allocation of foreign currency by the RBZ,” reads the council minutes. These vehicles were meant for the deputy heads of departments and RBZ had availed $50 000 for the purpose.” Council also noted that: “Willowvale had indicated that it was now a requirement for clients to pay directly to Chinese suppliers or manufacturers the foreign currency component of the vehicle purchase price. Thus the purchase of these vehicles had been affected by this requirement.” The council meeting noted that town clerk Mr Adolf Gusha was instructed to write a letter to the parent ministry — Local Government, Public Works and National Housing — to intervene in the allocation of foreign currency for the procurement of the service delivery vehicles. City deputy mayor Councillor James Chiwara said in an interview that the procurement of operational vehicles would add value to service delivery.
