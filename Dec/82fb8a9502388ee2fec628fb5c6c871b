Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain LONDON. — Jurgen Klopp has risked Arsene Wenger’s wrath ahead of Liverpool’s visit to the Emirates Stadium by claiming the Arsenal manager failed to get the best out of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Oxlade-Chamberlain joined Liverpool in August after Wenger decided to cash in before the England midfielder’s contract expired. The 24-year-old never quite lived up to his early promise at Arsenal after his switch from Southampton. But, after a slow start at Liverpool following his ($46 million) move, Oxlade-Chamberlain has started to hit his stride in recent weeks — just in time for his first return to Emirates tonight. The match kicks-off at 9:45pm. Reds boss Klopp has been impressed by Oxlade-Chamberlain’s development at Anfield, saying: “He had to adapt. I know how it is if you’re kind of a big signing. “You have to perform immediately. But it’s difficult.“I was happy from the first day about his involvement, about his attitude, and since then he became more and more a Liverpool player.” But Klopp believes Oxlade-Chamberlain would already be an even more potent force if he had been instructed to add a goal threat to his game while he was with Arsenal. Oxlade-Chamberlain has scored just twice in 20 appearances for Liverpool and managed 20 goals in 198 games for Arsenal. Klopp believes that poor strike rate is down to Wenger prioritising the talents of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil. “I think the biggest improvement, or the biggest potential he still has, is really being involved in goalscoring situations, because he has it in himself,” Klopp said. — AFP.
