Tiger Woods LOS ANGELES. — Justin Thomas reckons a healthy Tiger Woods will have a good chance of challenging at April’s Masters golf tournament, while at the same time reserving judgment over the 14-times major champion’s comeback. Pointing out that several veterans have superb records at Augusta National, Thomas said on Monday that Woods could follow the example set by the likes of Bernhard Langer and Fred Couples. “If he’s healthy, there’s no reason he wouldn’t (play well),” Thomas said in a teleconference call. “There’s a reason Freddie played so well there for so long (and) Langer . . . because it’s such an advantage knowing the course and the more you play, the world of difference it makes.” Woods, who turns 42 on December 30, has won the Masters four times, most recently in 2005. — Reuters.
