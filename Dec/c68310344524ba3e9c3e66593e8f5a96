Luke Masomere Mukudzei Chingwere Midlands Bureau self-proclaimed doctor of football Luke “Vahombe” Masomere has bounced back to the game after signing a one-year renewable contract with newly formed Mutare-based club, Manica Diamonds. The club is owned by, Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) and will be competing in the Eastern Region Division One next season. A nomadic coach, Masomere won the championship with Amazulu in 2003 and also had stints with Dynamos, How Mine, Shabanie Mine, Masvingo United among a host of clubs he has served. But the coach whose rhetoric has been conspicuously absent from the media interviews, claimed he was on a sabbatical from football until the diamond miners approached him. Some clubs in the Premier Soccer League were rumoured to be considering recruiting the coach but Masomere chose a team in the second tier league ostensibly for the funding potential it is likely to enjoy.
