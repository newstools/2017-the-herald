Davido Arts Reporter Nigerian superstar Davido is expected in the country today ahead of his show at Alexandra Sports Club tonight. Davido will share the stage with Jah Prayzah and a number of DJs that will spice up the event. It will be the last show featuring an international star in Harare for 2017 and people are looking forward to the event. Davido was expected to visit the country earlier, but his previous shows were postponed for different reasons. However, the Nigerian singer promised that he would fulfil the assignment before the end of the year and tonight’s show will finalise the arrangement. Organisers of the show 2Kings Entertainment said they are happy Davido will finally make it for the tour. “He was disappointed that he could not make it for previously arranged gigs and we are happy that he will finally make it this time. We are looking forward to a big event. People have been asking about the trip and we want to assure them that Davido will make it this time around. He is excited over the show,” said Dee Nish of 2Kings Entertainment. Jah Prayzazh’s camp is also ecstatic about the gig. The musician’s manager Keen Mushapaidze said they have prepared well for the show. “We are more than excited to announce that we will finally have our duet ‘My Lilly’ with Davido on stage. People have been waiting for the day and the day has now come. Fans should come in their numbers to have the best time to say goodbye to 2017 with an international star on stage. We are ready for the event. We have prepared well and we will deliver the best,” said Mushapaidze. The show comes as Jah Prayzah’s camp is in high spirits following an exceptional outing in Malawi where he reportedly staged a brilliant act at Blantyre Sports Club last weekend.
