Fungai Lupande Senior Court Reporter SELF-STYLED prophet Gathry Chiredzero, popularly known as Madzibaba Gathry, was back in court last week on allegations of running away from paying close to $4 000 maintenance arrears. He has been on the run since August when he was ordered to clear the arrears by the court. Through his lawyer Mr John Ndomene, Chiredzero said he had paid $200, but had lost the receipts. “His house was ransacked by the military police and he has lost all his particulars,” said Mr Ndomene. “He does not have proof of the payments.” Harare magistrate Ms Josephine Sande asked how Chiredzero had paid the money, and he said he did not know the complainant in the matter. The complainant is Tariro Bhinzi and Chiredzero was ordered to pay $150 maintenance per month for one child. Last Friday, Chiredzero was denied bail on allegations of stalking President Emmerson Mnangagwa at State functions. In his bail application, he said he was an informer to the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) and was not in possession of his firearm when he was arrested at Josiah Magama Tongogara Barracks. He was remanded in custody to December 28. Through his lawyer, Chiredzero submitted that the CIO officials should come to validate how his identification documents were fake. “The accused is an informant to the CIO and they should come to court to explain how his identity cards are said to be fake. He was not in possession of a firearm at the time of his arrest because he had booked and left it at the entrance,” said Mr Ndomene. It is alleged that Chiredzero positioned himself near the podium where the President was speaking at the swearing-in of Cabinet ministers at State House and at the renaming of King George VI Barracks to Josiah Magama Tongogara Barracks while in possession of a loaded 38 Special Amadeo Rossi S.A Revolver serial number AA757095.
