TK Hollun Yeukai Karengezeka-Chisepo Arts Correspondent South Africa-based Zimbabwean musician Tendekayi Mushekwi, affectionately known as TK Hollun, has dropped a jam titled “Mukana” which he says is a Christmas present for his fans. The dancehall track features upcoming Zimdancehall star Legend Elly and was produced with the help of Nigerian Captain Blue and James Adam of the Chitsidzo fame. In an interview from his base, Hollun said he believes the song will become a favourite of many in this festive season. “I am really optimistic that this single will become a darling of many because of the rich content and the fast tempo feel attached to it. That is my Christmas present and a reminder to my fans that I love them very much and I am still in the game,” he said. “Mukana”, which literally means another chance is an appreciative song that reflects on how many good things God did for his people throughout the year including the gift of life, job opportunities just to mention a few. The track is off his forthcoming album due for release early next year. I will be coming home next year with a new album due for release in February and the whole album is currently under construction at his Shakestone Studios in Durban. “I will also tour major cities across the country as part of the marketing strategy of the album,” Hollun said. Hollun who was one of pioneers of urban grooves music said his studio has steadily gained popularity by recording both upcoming and established artistes. “I have been recording upcoming artistes especially from Zimbabwe as well as other established artistes across Africa. Competition is getting tough though as more studios are mushrooming,” he said. In October he released a single titled “Ikoko” which was accompanied by a video. The “Ndafunga Kure” hit-maker last produced an album in 2014 that was named “Hollun Vibez” that was received well by his fans.
