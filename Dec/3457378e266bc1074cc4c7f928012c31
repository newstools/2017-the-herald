Lazarus “Gringo” Boora Conrad Mupesa Correspondent A MHANGURA businessman and farmer has donated food hampers to 15 elderly men and women in the town. The donation brought Christmas cheers to the elderly people. Mr James Masango gave out the hampers to elderly people during the annual Wasara-Wasara Draw, which the businessman hosts at his shop in Mhangura. The elderly were full of praise for the Masango family for remembering them during the festive season. The hampers consisted of cooking oil, flour, sugar, mealie-meal and toiletries. “We are grateful to Mr Masango and his wife for their generosity. The hampers will allow us to feast together with our families during this festive season,” said 70-year-old Mr Ronard Paulosi. Mr Daniel Tala thanked the businessman for the gesture, saying his family was finding it hard to make ends meet. “This is a pleasant surprise for Christmas and it will be a holiday with a difference,” he said. Mrs Precious Masango, wife of the businessman and also Zanu- PF Mashonaland West Women’s League health secretary, said communities should remember the elderly as they were fountains of knowledge, morals and values. Mhangura is made up of mostly pensioners and the elderly who used to work for the decommissioned mine and have no other means of survival. They called on Government to address the three-tier pricing model being used for services and goods. Meanwhile, orphans at Eden Children’s Village in Doma, Mhangura received a Christmas of a lifetime when popular comedian Lazarus “Gringo” Boora teamed up with two gospel musicians Aleck Dumbu and Pastor Marvelous Masina to offer them entertainment. The orphans sang and danced along to the musicians and laughed to the jokes from the comedian.
