Zvenyika Makonese Mukudzei Chingwere Midlands Bureau Seemingly ageless Shabanie Mine defender Zvenyika Makonese is set to be one of the oldest players in the Castle Lager Premiership next season after he indicated yesterday that he is available to continue playing the year that he turns 41. The veteran former Zimbabwe and Orlando Pirates defender has of late been deployed as a centre striker and with Shabanie having survived relegation, Makonese wants 2018 to be his swansong season as he intends to retire and venture into coaching. Makonese said he will use next season to pursue local coaching badges. But before that could happen, his prayer is that Shabanie Mine, whose franchise is up for sale will hold onto their Premiership status and afford him the opportunity to become one of the oldest players in the league. Another defender who was set to turn 41 in 2018 Brighton Chandisaita of Black Rhinos announced his retirement on Wednesday night. “Next season I will be playing football again but I think it will be my last season as a player. In football however, you never know if clubs still want you to continue. I will decide the way forward for the 2019 season. “When I finally leave the game as a player I want to continue as a coach and this coming season I will be attending coaching courses. Hopefully the courses will be coming to Zvishavane so that it will not clash with my core business of playing. I have heard many reports that the club might be sold but my hope and prayer is for Shabanie Mine not be sold and continue to be a Zvishavane team that we grew up knowing,” said Makonese “My dream is to continue playing for them and one day to become coach at my favourite club. So if it is sold my dreams will be shattered.” Makonese, who has a giant stature, has had an illustrious football career, that at 40, he was still faithful to his coach, Takesure Chiragwi, who apparently is six years junior.
