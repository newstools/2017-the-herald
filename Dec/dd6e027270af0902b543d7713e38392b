In a statement the group said they decided to have the track for fun-loving people of Zimbabwe. “It has been an eventful year and festive season is here. We need to celebrate together. You might not have received that stocking filler gift yet but worry not, Kambo Boys have your festive expectations already covered. Their new song is out and it is a hot cake,” reads the statement. “Merry Christmas” is a song that has many musical instruments with a dendera feel. Kambo Boys kept their vocals flowing as they also urge drivers to be cautious during the festive season. “Kambo Boys say this song does not particularly link to the birth of Jesus but to holiday, good spirit of giving, loving, sharing and togetherness that comes with such a juncture,” reads the statement. Their album will be coming next year, though they did not give specific dates. The boys just dropped a single, but an album is to follow in 2018. The group has slowly been gaining a niche audience, most who appreciate their creativity and effort to infuse quality and swag to sungura, as well as take sungura to world stage. They will be releasing the video for the song so that people have an appreciation of the music. The song was mixed and mastered at Vhiyali Studios owned by Munya Vhiyali.
