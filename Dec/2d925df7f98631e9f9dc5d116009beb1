JOHANNESBURG. — Rohit Sharma has been unable to cement his place in India’s Test cricket side, but the right-handed batsman continues to show he has what it takes to succeed in the limited-over format. After making his debut in the shorter form of the game in 2007, Rohit was hailed as the biggest thing to come out of Mumbai since Sachin Tendulkar, with his elegant batting style and ability to hit big shots, seemingly with ease. The 30-year-old is an automatic choice in the limited-overs side and scored his third one-day international double 100 against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, leading the side in the absence of rested regular captain Virat Kohli. Rohit completed his 16th 100 in the 50-over format in 115 deliveries and then laid waste to the Sri Lankan bowlers, remaining unbeaten on 208 off 153 deliveries. That seems to be the template for the man who now has three out of the seven double 100s in one-day internationals. — Reuters.
