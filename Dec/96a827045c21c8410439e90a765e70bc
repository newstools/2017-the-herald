President Mnangagwa Blessings Chidakwa Correspondent Zanu-pf Mashonaland West province Youth League has said it owes allegiance to President Emmerson Mnangagwa and war veterans for being among the first people in the party to brazenly declare the ouster of former President Robert Mugabe. The provincial leadership said, they would return the favour through the ballot box. In an interview on the sidelines of Zvimba Youth League inter-district meeting yesterday, provincial vice chairperson, Cde Joseph Chareka said the league was prepared to return the favour by ensuring that zanu-pf won next year’s elections resoundingly. “As youths, we want a landslide victory for our party in 2018 elections. We have a credit to pay to our war veterans and our President. For the past 37 years, no one had the tenacity and audacity to challenge former President Mugabe, except for them,” he said. Cde Chareka urged youths to take advantage of the extended biometric voter registration dates by Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to register to vote. “We are the pillar of the party, we constitute the majority of numbers in both the party and country, if we register to vote, the party will be guaranteed a landslide victory,” he said. Provincial Youth League secretary for administration, Cde Ability Gandawa noted that youths were set to benefit from the farm downsizing exercise.
