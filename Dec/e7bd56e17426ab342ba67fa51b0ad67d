LONDON. — Conor McGregor insists there is still plenty left to come from him as a fighter. The 29-year-old has not competed since his 10th-round stoppage loss to Floyd Mayweather in August and has yet to schedule another fight in either boxing or mixed martial arts. Despite not competing in the UFC since November 2016, McGregor remains the organisation’s lightweight champion, though Tony Ferguson has since been crowned interim lightweight champion. UFC president Dana White stated in October a fight between McGregor and Ferguson “has to happen”, while the Irish star has also been called out by Manny Pacquiao. Nothing has yet been announced regarding McGregor’s next fight but he insists he still maintains his passion for fighting and will not retire while he is still in his physical prime. “I always look at the end from a damage-taken standpoint,” McGregor told Sky Sports News. “How much damage have I taken? How is my brain? How is my mental health? How is my physical body? How is my training? How is my preparation? How is my hunger for it? “That is where I gauge how long I will do it and there is still a lot left in me. It is not necessarily a money thing for me. I am passionate about fighting. Fighting is what I love to do. I will continue to do it as long as I am healthy and willing to put in the work that it takes to do. “I will not be stupid though. I will not notice things about myself and then continue to do it like many others before me. It is a dangerous, ruthless business and I am aware of that. Thankfully I am in a position of great wealth. I do not need to do it. I am doing it for the love of it. “I will make my decision when the time comes.” — Sky Sports.
