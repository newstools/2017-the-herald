Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter Ngezi Platinum Stars are set to celebrate their fine run in the Premiership this season despite missing on the championship by holding end of year awards for their players tonight. The club has done relatively well in their two-year stay in the top flight where they have sized up well with the established teams. Ngezi Platinum Stars were pipped to the league title by sister club FC Platinum having fought so gallantly for the larger part of the season and at some point being tipped for the honours. The club contributed the highest number of players on this year’s Castle Lager Premiership Soccer Star awards with the trio of Qadr Amini, Tichaona Mabvura and Terrence Dzvukamanja making it on the calendar. Big clubs such as champions FC Platinum, Dynamos, Chicken Inn and CAPS United contributed two players each. And tonight it promises to be a tight contest pitting the trio for the club’s Player of the Year Award. Mabvura had a good season where he scored eight goals and weighed in with 15 assists. Defender Amini also put up a good show with seven league goals. Dzvukamanja ended the season as the club’s top scorer with nine goals to secure the Golden Boot. He is bracing himself up for what might turn out to be double delight this evening. The club spokesperson Chiedza Mupfumira yesterday said they have 10 categories in which players will receive prizes. “The first award goes to our developmental team where we are recognising the Player of the year. We are also taking the time to appreciate our supporters and the Club President will present the Presidential Award for the Supporter of the year,’ she said. The players will also vote for their Player’s Player of the Year, while more players are set to be recognised in other categories such as the Most Disciplined Player of the Year, Most Loyal Player of the Year, Most Improved Player of the Year, Most Promising Young Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year.
