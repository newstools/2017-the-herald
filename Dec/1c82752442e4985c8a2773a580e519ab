Runesu GwidiÂ Masvingo Correspondent A gold panner from Zivanai Village under Chief Hwedza in Zvishavane has been accused of breaking into a kiosk at Clipsham Farm in Masvingo before raping the 16-year-old attendant. Prosper Msipa (26) is further alleged to have threatened the teenager with a knife, before robbing her of cash and other goods valued at $180. Msipa appeared before Masvingo magistrate Takawira Mugabe last week facing charges of unlawful entry, rape and robbery. According to the State, Msipa, a well-known gold panner, on November 30 at around 2am, went to the kiosk where the teenager put-up during the night. The girl reportedly knew Msipa, who was a regular customer. Prosecutor Mr Edmore Mapope told the court that Msipa misrepresented to the girl that he was someone else, before threatening to kill her if she did not open the shop. Msipa allegedly forced open the door and grabbed the girl who was trying to escape and she managed to free herself from his grip, but he tripped her to the ground, and raped her before force-marching her back into the kiosk.
