LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo helped Real Madrid win the Club World Cup — then demanded they pay him more than Lionel Messi. Ronaldo scored a free-kick which went through the defensive wall to break Gremio’s brave resistance and give Real Madrid a 1-0 victory in the final. It secured Real their second world title in a row, the third in the last four seasons, and ended Gremio’s hopes of pulling off what would have been a huge upset. Ronaldo currently earns £18.5 million a year at Real but arch rival Messi, the man he beat to this year’s Ballon d’Or, is on £26.4m. That followed a new huge contract that Messi signed with Barcelona last month. Spanish newspaper Marca put a huge picture of Ronaldo on their front page this morning with the headline: “Cristiano quiere mas”. That translates to “Cristiano wants more.” They state that Ronaldo now wants the same salary Messi or Neymar which would equate to a near 50 per cent pay rise. Marca state, however, that Real will not yet open negotiations. Ronaldo signed a new five-year deal last year but he insisted then that would not be his last. The Portuguese superstar (33) was hailed by his teammates after firing Real to Club World Cup success. Substitute Lucas Vazquez told his club’s official website after the Abu Dhabi success: “Before the game, I told Cristiano I was sure he was going to score and that’s why he ran to me for the celebration. — The Daily Express.
