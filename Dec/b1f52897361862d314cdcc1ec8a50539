MADRID. — “The expectations of Real Madrid are to have the best,” they could easily be the words of world famous player or coach, but it is the club’s English groundsman Paul Burgess who is reflecting on the demanding culture at the Spanish soccer giants. Burgess’s work will be seen by an estimated television audience of 650 million people when newly crowned world champions Madrid host Barcelona in El Clasico tomorrow at 2pm. However, he is used to dealing with that pressure having been lured to Real in Galatico style in 2009 after winning Premier League groundsman of the year three times in 12 years at Arsenal. “Real Madrid and Spain is like the dream move for anybody whether it be the groundsman, the footballer or the press officer,” Burgess said on a cold and grey Madrid morning with preparations for the Clasico in full swing. “That’ll be the sunniest place in Madrid today,” he added pointing to the rows of high-powered lights beaming down on one side of a pitch that has to cope with plus 40 degree heat in summer and freezing temperatures in winter. “For El Clasico there is obviously more build-up, more cameras on the side of the pitch, everyone is talking about it so there is more pressure from the outside.” A two-week layoff since Real’s last home game, though, has ensured Burgess’s best work will be on show for the big day. — AFP
