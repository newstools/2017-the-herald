Under the country’s customs laws, visitors or Zimbabweans working outside the country who drive foreign registered vehicles, are allowed to bring in the cars duty free for a period of 30 days and renew at the expiry of that window. In case of defaulting, the vehicles are either seized or the owners are fined $500. In addition, motorists are allowed a window period of one week to exit the country from the date of the expiry of the TIP. However, unscrupulous customs officers take advantage of this misinformation and fleece motorists of money during the one week window.
