Prof Murwira Herald reporter Higher Education, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Amon Murwira yesterday called on the Management Training Bureau (MTB) in Msasa to urgently adopt a high performance culture in line with its training mandate. Minister Murwira met with MTB management and staff during a tour of the institution’s facilities and operations and told them to up their game and do away the idleness. In a statement issued following the tour, Prof Murwira challenged the institution to upscale and internationally benchmark its skills training and business operations through local and international public-private partnerships. He also pledged his support for the institution and highlighted that bureaucracy and laziness would not be tolerated. “Implement performance contracts in line with Government’s 100-day plan given Zimbabwe’s new economic development thrust,” read the statement. “Offer courses of high economic impact within the shortest possible time covering both the private and the public sectors, to also carve outs niche within the broad skills development market, through targeted programmes,” he said. “You should run training programmes that provide the required skills to grow the economy in line with the inauguration speech by His Excellency the President,” continued the statement, highlighting the major aspects that MTB’s management and staff must prioritise. Prof Murwira dismissed earlier hearsay concerning alleged changes to MTB’s mandate. “The minister dispelled earlier communication about the pending changes to MTB’s mandate and possible retrenchments saying the Government fully acknowledged and appreciated the institution’s role in Zimbabwe’s new era,” the statement read.
