Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter TINASHE Madziwana of Delta Force Academy yesterday received his prize money and Toyota Hiace which were at stake when he defeated Malawian boxer Robert Kachiza in the sixth round of an elimination bout at the Stodart Hall complex in Mbare over the weekend. The win ensured that Madziwana secured a ticket to fight Tapiwa Tembo for the vacant WBF super bantamweight title and the sponsors of last Saturday’s bout — Gyprite — honoured their pledge yesterday with the $2 000 prize money as well as the Toyota Hiace vehicle. The tournament had several companies that were bankrolling the event and these included Gypsite Construction and Civil, YAD, Et Cetera Media Advertisers and Top Team. Madziwana expressed gratitude at the hand-over ceremony and said he is not going to look back but will continue to work harder until his next match which is likely to be against Tembo. “I am very excited to receive both my money and the vehicle which was at stake and I am very grateful to the sponsors Gypsite Construction and Civil. It has always been my wish to represent the country at national level and I think we are getting there slowly,’’ said Madziwana. Madziwana won the elimination fight via a knock-out in the sixth of the scheduled eight round contest. His victory ensured passage to meet Tembo for the vacant WBF super bantamweight title fight on January 28.
