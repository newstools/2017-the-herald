Tryson Chimbetu performs live at The Herald end of year party on Saturday Vongai Mbara Arts Reporter It was a day to throw pens and notebooks on the dance floor. It is rare to see them on the dancefloor. Usually they will be reporting about others thrilling through music and dance, but last Saturday was a different case. They had fun and showcased some captivating dance routines. The venue was Spillway Pub and Grill and the event was The Herald end-of-year party. The musician on stage was Tryson Chimbetu and everything was just electric. Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services Band warmed up the stage performing a number of cover songs from different genres. They belted out songs such as Jah Prayzah’s current hits “Kutonga Kwaro”, “Ndini Ndamubata” and Alick Macheso’s “Charakupa”. Chimbetu came on stage at around 7pm putting up a sterling performance complemented by well-choreographed dances that left the audience jovial. He opened up his act with his late uncle Simon’s yesteryear hits taking revelers down memory lane. He also dished out some tracks from his albums including “Pahotera” that features Oliver Mtukudzi, and “Mombe” which proved to be many’s favourite. Speaking at the special occasion, The Herald editor-in-chief Caesar Zvayi encouraged workers to continue working as a united family. “I want to thank Zimpapers for the wonderful job. We are the best in the country because of your hard work .When others stand, we outstand and I want to encourage you to continue with that spirit. We are not co-workers but we are a united family,” said Zvayi.
