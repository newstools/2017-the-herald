Tererai Mugwadi Lovemore Meya Court Correspondent Musician Tererai Mugwadi was on Thursday found guilty of culpable homicide charges after she was involved in an accident which claimed the life of Seremani Marvellous. She was remanded to next Tuesday for sentencing. Mugwadi (32) of Mt Hampden, near Harare had maintained her innocence after her application for discharge was thrown out before Chitungwiza magistrate Mr Oliver Mudzongachiso. This follows her denial of the charges when her trial commenced, however, Mr Mudzongachiso said she had a case to answer. In his judgment, Mr Mudzongachiso said Mugwadi’s defence was a sign of desperation. “The accused was charged with the offence of culpable homicide,” said Mr Mudzongachiso. “She pleaded not guilty and I say out of sheer arrogance she admitted being the driver, got dazzled after lights flashed her. Although witnesses testified, this is a matter which speaks on its own. She got dazzled and what was reasonable under the circumstances was to pull off the road and stop instead of continuing to drive as she did. In her defence outline she admitted being dazzled, why continue?” Mr Mudzongachiso said it was this disregard of road rules that led to the accident. “It is in the process of continuing to move that she hit the vehicle. Furthermore, she admits she could not see, so why continue driving, she is guilty as charged,” ruled Mr Mudzongachiso. Prosecutor Mrs Itai Chikono proved that on June 23 this year at around 8.40pm, Mugwadi was driving a Toyota Rav4 along Seke Road under the influence of alcohol. The court heard that Mugwadi failed to control her vehicle, swerved and encroached into a lane with oncoming traffic. Mugwadi hit a Toyota Hiace truck, which was being driven by Tichaona Takaeneya and it overturned. The accident killed Seremani Marvellous, a passenger, who was sitting at the back of the vehicle. The matter was reported to the police leading to Mugwadi’s arrest.
