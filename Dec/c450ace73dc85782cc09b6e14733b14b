Insp Mazula said police would be on patrol across the province. “We are deploying our details for the festive period,” she said. “There will be patrols both on foot or bicycles and vehicles. We want to ensure that every citizen is allowed to enjoy the festive season.” Insp Mazula said the ban on dangerous weapons still stood and urged members of the public not to carry any when moving around. “Those found with dangerous weapons such as knives, knobkerries, machetes and spears will be arrested,” she said. “We also urge residents to inform police when they are leaving their houses for holiday during this period. They can leave relatives or anyone known to them to protect their houses.” Masvingo Consumer Council of Zimbabwe provincial chairman Mr Jowere Mukusha said motorists should also observe travellers’ rights by not speeding during this festive season. “I know a lot of people will be travelling to their rural homes during the festive season,” he said. “Travellers have the right to life and that means they should express their concern freely if the driver is speeding. “This mostly applies to public passenger vehicles, which will be carrying many passengers. Motorists are expected to travel at recommended speed to avoid road traffic accidents.”
