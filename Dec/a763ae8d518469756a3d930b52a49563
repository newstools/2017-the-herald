MADRID. — Rafa Nadal has withdrawn from next week’s season-opening exhibition tennis event in Abu Dhabi due to ongoing fitness problems, the world number one has said. The 16-time grand slam champion, who won the French and US Opens earlier this year, withdrew from the ATP Finals in November after struggling with a knee injury during his round-robin defeat by Belgian David Goffin. The 31-year-old Spaniard, who has previously played at the tournament on eight occasions, will be replaced by compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut. “It was a tough 2017 and I need to take my calendar in a different way in order to be ready,” Nadal told the Mubadala World Tennis Championships website. “For this reason, I have sadly announced to the organizers and now to you fans that I won’t play this time in Abu Dhabi.” — Reuters.
