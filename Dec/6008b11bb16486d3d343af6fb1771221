Eden Hazard LONDON. – Eden Hazard’s father has sensationally hinted his son is inviting a move from Real Madrid in the summer. Hazard’s father claims the forward has rejected a contract extension at Chelsea but says there has been no contact with Real Madrid. The Belgian has been linked with a move to the Bernabeu for some time and has professed his admiration in the past for Zinedine Zidane, saying last month that it would be a “dream” to play under the Real Madrid boss. Reports earlier this month suggested that the 26-year-old was stalling on signing a new deal at Stamford Bridge and Thierry Hazard claims his son has rejected the chance to extend his contract, which runs until 2020, as speculation persists over a potential transfer to the European champions. The Belgium international currently has over two years left on his current contract at Stamford Bridge. But speculation in the summer suggested Real could soon make a move for Hazard with both Zinedine Zidane and Florentino Perez keen admirers of Hazard. No offer was made in the end but Chelsea want to push through a new contract for Hazard to prevent him from leaving in the near future. However, they face a battle on their hands to push through an extension. That’s because Hazard’s father, Thierry Hazard, has claimed his son rejected the Blues’ latest offer. – The Daily Express.
