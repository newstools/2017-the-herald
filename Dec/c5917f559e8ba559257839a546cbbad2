Heather Charema and Blessings Chidakwa ENVIRONMENTAL Management Agency (EMA) has expressed concern over veld fires in Mashonaland West province, leading to environmental damage, loss of lives and property. Nationally, Mashonaland West and Mashonaland Central are the most affected by veld fires. Speaking at the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists Mashonaland West Provincial Journalism Awards in Chinhoyi over the weekend, EMA board member and chairperson of the sub-committee on solid waste management Mrs Barbra Rwodzi said the high number of veld fires in the province were a cause for major concern. “Mash West province has the largest number of veld fires countrywide and this is a big issue of concern for us as EMA. The environment should be everyone’s priority because we all depend on it. Communities should work together in combating veld fires and protecting our environment, lives and property,” she said. Mrs Rwodzi commended the media for coverage of environmental issues, saying they helped to raise awareness in communities. “I would like to commend the media for the coverage they give to environmental issues as well as raising awareness in the community. Despite high incidence on veld fires, Mashonaland West this year witnessed a reduction in the total area affected this year,” she said. In view of the high incidence of veld fires and the attendant damage to property, lives and the environment, Government launched the command veld fire management programme to prevent veld fires. Most cases are reported in resettlement and communal areas.
