Archbishop Johannes Ndanga Herald Reporter The Apostolic Christian Council of Zimbabwe has recalled its president Archbishop Johannes Ndanga on allegations of flagrant violation of the organisation’s constitution and making unilateral appointments, among other charges. ACCZ provincial chairpersons and coordinators met on Sunday and resolved to recall Archbishop Ndanga and scrapped the life presidency position he had bestowed upon himself. In a letter to Archbishop Ndanga, ACCZ said:“It is with grave sadness that we are recalling you from the Apostolic Christian Council of Zimbabwe presidency with immediate effect because of the blatant violations of our governing constitution which you are supposed to uphold,” reads the letter.
