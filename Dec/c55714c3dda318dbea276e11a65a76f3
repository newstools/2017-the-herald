Emmanuel Eboue LONDON. — Since he hit rock-bottom and admitted he had contemplated suicide Emmanuel Eboue has been inundated by football fans wishing him well – and now former club Arsenal are set to become involved in a bid to help. Gunners cult hero Eboue revealed he had seriously considered taking his own life after financial mismanagement has left him penniless, with a bitter divorce meaning he has been estranged from his three children since the summer. But the North London side – who he played for between 2005 and 2011 – are set to examine ways they can support the popular Eboue. Sportsmail contacted the English Premier League giants to ask if they had considered helping the 34-year-old after his former club Galatasaray announced they had offered him an academy coaching role in Turkey. An Arsenal spokesman responded by saying: “We are all so sorry to hear the reports about Manu’s recent difficulties and will explore whether we can help in any way.” — The Daily Mail.
