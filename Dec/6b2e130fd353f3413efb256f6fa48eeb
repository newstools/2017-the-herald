Mehluli “Taz” Moyo Arts Correspondent Afro-pop and jazz sensation, Mehluli “Taz” Moyo will today launch a single titled “Ndoenda”, which he said is derived from the struggles of women. The single “Ndoenda” tells the story of a woman whose in-laws and husband’s extended family subject her to verbal and emotional abuse. “Such abuse in many cases leads to resentment towards one’s spouse, depression and can ultimately break families up. This song is in line with contributing to annual global commemorations from November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to December 10, Human Rights Day, the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign, which is a time to galvanise action to end violence against women and girls around the world,” said Taz. “The song ‘Ndoenda’ seeks to carry the campaign and voice of women throughout the year and provide a pillar of strength for all women and men to collectively fight gender-based violence in communities.” Taz is an innovative and talented music artist who started his music career at a tender age and is now aiming to export the educational and entertainment aspects of his music to the world at large and spearheading fight against domestic violence. The musician is passionate in fighting many social ills faced in our societies including Gender Based Violence, poverty reduction and promotion of peace and reconciliation amongst Africans.
