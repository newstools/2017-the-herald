Chris Martin Sindiso Dube The much-anticipated Jamaican chanter Chris Martin’s Harare tour has been postponed. The “Cheaters Prayer” hit-maker was scheduled to perform at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) on December 21 backed by Zimbabwe’s most sought after contemporary musician Jah Prayzah. But true to recent form, 2 Kings Entertainment let the show crash and burn spectacularly. “The show has been postponed due to reasons beyond our control, we will advise on a suitable date for next year. We will definitely bring back the chanter for our fans next year,” said Dee Nosh of 2 Kings Entertainment after being prodded into commenting. They had previously not issued any statement to the media or the fans, probably hoping they would develop some bout of amnesia and forget that there was such a show billed for the festive season. Chris Martin’s postponement makes it the third show in two months to be called off by the award winning promotions company 2 Kings Entertainment. Earlier this month they called off a rescheduled gig pitting Nigerian super star Davido and Jah Prayzah. The chanter came onto the scene in 2005 when he won the talent search competition Digicel Birch in Jamaica. He is well known for hits like “Paper Loving”, “Reggae Road Block”, “Mi Friend Dem”, “My Love for you” and” Jamaican Girls” among others.
