Clr Chikozho Grace Nyoni Midlands Reporter The 2017 edition of the Gweru Mayor’s Christmas Cheer Fund has raised over $15 000, with pledges continuing to pour in, the city’s mayor Councillor Charles Chikozho has said. Money and donations received under the fund is channelled towards the less-privileged in the community. In an interview yesterday, Clr Chikozho said they managed to raise more cash and pledges than last year. “We managed to raise money which amounts to $12 000, as well as pledges for the fund,” he said. “The pledges continue coming in and we are likely to surpass last year’s donations.” Clr Chikozho said the money raised from the cheer fund was used for Christmas donations, while the cash will be used to pay school fees for selected orphans in and around Gweru. He said there were 18 orphans picked from various schools who will benefit. “We were helped by the heads from these 18 schools and they are set to benefit. We also donated groceries to the old people’s homes and institutions like Jairos Jiri,” he said.
