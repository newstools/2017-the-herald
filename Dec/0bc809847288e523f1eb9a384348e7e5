Sharon Chiware Midlands Reporter Most shops in Gweru have hiked prices of basic commodities after bakeries increased that of bread on Sunday. A snap survey conducted by this paper yesterday showed that most retail shops like OK, TM and Pick n Pay had reviewed prices of basic commodities upwards. An OK loaf of bread is now going for $1,20 up from 0,70c, while a Pick n Pay loaf of bread is now selling at $1, up from 0,80c. A 2kg packet of Mahatma rice has increased from $2,70 to $3, while a 2 litre bottle of cooking was yesterday selling at between $4,40 and $4,50 depending with the shop, up from between $3,50 and $4. Dairy products like yoghurt and fresh milk which have been selling for 0,50c have also been reviewed upwards to 0,60c Consumers interviewed yesterday condemned the price hike, saying Government should move in to curb the problem. They said retailers were taking advantage of the festive season to make a killing through unjustified price hikes. “Our new President, Cde Emmerson Mnangagwa, has said we are opening a new era in our country and retailers seem to be trying to sabotage his vision by sticking to old habits of wantonly hiking prices of basic commodities,” said Mr Hlangano Hungwe of Mkoba 16. “Such acts should be stopped.” Another consumer, Ms Nancy Muyangeni, said the hiking of prices during the festive season was deliberate on the part of retailers. “It is just a deliberate move to try and maximize sales during the festive season. What has caused them to hike prices when there has not been a change of prices from the wholesalers?,” she said.
