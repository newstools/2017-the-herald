LONDON. – Arsenal have been told they must spend £40million to land Julian Draxler. The Germany forward has been a long-term target for Arsene Wenger. He joined PSG last year from Wolfsburg but the 24-year-old has failed to truly impress since. Arsenal have long been admirers of Draxler and now they could be encouraged to make a move when the window re-opens for business. PSG are determined to rival Manchester City for the signature of Alexis Sanchez. And with the Gunners reportedly ready to listen to bids of £35m for the Chile international in January, Draxler could head in the opposite direction. City, however, are understood to be the favourite to sign Sanchez but won’t move for him until the end of the season. That could open the door to PSG to swoop in under their noses, especially with Sanchez free to leave for nothing when his contract expires next summer. Draxler, according to a report in The Sun , is open to a move to the Emirates. Wenger also wants Chelsea target Leon Bailey to replace Manchester City-bound Sanchez at Arsenal, reports say. – The Mirror.
