Sukoluhle Ndlovu Midlands Correspondent TWO armed robbers from Zvishavane yesterday appeared in court for allegedly fatally stabbing a woman before robbing her of 25 cents and a bottle of purified water. Wellington Maphosa (25) and Hosea Vengesai (33) went on to strip their victim, Ms Varaidzo Sibanda and left her lying in a pool of blood. They were not asked to plead when they appeared before Zvishavane magistrate Mr Shepherd Munjanja, who remanded them in custody next Thursday and advised them to seek bail at the High Court. The prosecutor Mr Stanley Ncube told the court that on December 9, 2017, and around midday, Ms Sibanda was walking along a footpath on her way to the city centre from Highlands suburb. Maphosa and Vengesai emerged from the bush and one of them produced a knife demanding cash. Ms Sibanda told them that she only had 25 cents and a bottle of water which she refused to surrender. One of the suspects stabbed Ms Sibanda on the left side of her breast and on the back before they took the 25 cents and the bottle of water. Ms Sibanda collapsed and was later discovered by a passer-by who rushed her to hospital where she died on admission. The matter was reported to the police.
