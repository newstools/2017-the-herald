JUBA. — Three Western countries yesterday called on South Sudan’s warring parties to make concessions during the next round of peace talks slated for Monday in Ethiopia. The United States, Norway and Britain which are members of the Troika (peace deal guarantors), said to achieve a sustainable peace, no party to the conflict can have undue influence or a veto on the process, including the government. “All parties must engage sincerely and make concessions in the national interest; otherwise, the conflict and suffering will continue,” said the peace guarantors. Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) will convene the High-Level Revitalisation Forum (HLRF) for the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan on Dec. 18 in Addis Ababa. The Western nations said IGAD’s ability to solve this crisis depends on unity of purpose amongst its members, and called on regional countries to speak with one voice. “As the Troika has previously stated, the HLRF and its outcome must be genuinely inclusive and reflect the political reality of South Sudan today,” they said. The Troika vowed to stand with IGAD in its efforts to make progress toward peace and effective implementation of the Agreement and warned of severe action against those who obstruct the process. — Xinhua.
