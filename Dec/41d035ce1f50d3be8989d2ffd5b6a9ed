Prof Francis Gudyanga Takunda Maodza News Editor— FORMER Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development secretary Francis Gudyanga was yesterday arrested for corruption. He was picked up by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) and is now in custody at Rhodesville Police Station in Harare. He is expected to appear in court today. ZACC spokesperson Ms Phyllis Chikundura confirmed Gudyanga’s arrest. “We have arrested Gudyanga,” she said. “He is detained at Rhodesville Police Station and is appearing in court tomorrow.” The Herald is reliably informed that Gudyanga was arrested for suspected cases of corruption he committed when he was Permanent secretary in the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development. As was reported by The Herald then, Gudyanga chaired the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (MMCZ) since 2013. He never convened a meeting of the board, but claimed $28 000 in board sitting allowances. Gudyanga was the only board member and allegedly never consulted the acting general-manager Richard Chingodza and the corporation’s secretary Nomsa Moyo, whom he was supposed to hold meetings with, according to the Company Act. He is on record telling the Harare magistrates court during the trial of MMCZ bosses that he paid himself board fees when there was no board to talk of at the parastatal. Prof Gudyanga told the court in March this year while testifying against the MMCZ bosses: “It is not just sitting, but decision making. “No, it was not sitting fees, but board fees because we did not sit as a board. “The board is not all about sitting, but consultation and decision making. It took most of my time.” Prof Gudyanga received $875 monthly as board fees and $460 sitting fees for “sitting” 21 times, totalling $28 910.
