Eriah Tembo Herald Reporter Eria and Biggie Jnr, the sons of late Bhundu Boys lead vocalist Biggie Tembo, last week rocked Hurungwe district, the community in which their late iconic father was born, with an inspired performance. The brothers partnered Amnesty International Zimbabwe in commemorations to mark World Aids Day at Karuru Business Centre in Hurungwe West. They performed before thousands of people whom they left asking for more. The siblings, who have released three albums “Pachedu”, “Musandishore” and “Wandinzwa Here”, performed some of their late father’s songs, sending people into a frenzy. The crowd was particularly impressed by 28-year-old Eria, who gave a good account of himself. “My father was born in Doro village, which is a stone’s throw away from this business centre, and I know if he was alive he would be visiting his folks constantly just like what Oliver Mtukudzi does. I will do my best to remain in touch with the area that nurtured my father and the best way would be to entertain them through music,” said Eria. Eria said villagers in most remote areas rarely meet or see their favourite musicians performing live. “My brother and I never had the opportunity to be taught music by our late father. We were driven by the passion inside us, probably emanating from our late father’s musical genes. The best way to thank him for what he left in us is to remember where he started his music career,” said Biggie Jnr. Music luminary Biggie Tembo died in 1992, when Eria and Biggie Jnr were three and five years old respectively.
