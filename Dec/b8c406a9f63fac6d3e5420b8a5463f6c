In a statement, Zanu-PF spokesperson Cde Khaya Moyo said: “It has come to the attention of the party, Zanu-PF, that images of a clique of expelled Zanu-PF members of the G40 cabal namely; Ignatius Chombo, Kudzai Chipanga, Innocent Hamandishe and another person wearing regalia emblazoned with features depicting the President and First Secretary of the party, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, are widely circulating on a number of social media platforms. “The party wishes to make it clear that these expelled members have no entitlement to representing it and neither do they have the right to represent the President and First Secretary in any form,’’ Cde Khaya Moyo said.  He said their actions constituted serious criminal conduct. “These truant individuals are obviously bent on soiling the good name of the party and that of its President and First Secretary,” Cde Khaya Moyo said, adding that appropriate action will be taken against the culprits.
