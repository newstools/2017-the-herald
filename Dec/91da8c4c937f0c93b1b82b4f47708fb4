PERTH. - Nathan Lyon’s wish to see the end of some England careers after another Ashes cricket whitewash could easily come true if the tourists’ struggling senior players fail to lift quickly, former Australia paceman Mitchell Johnson has said. Johnson captured 37 wickets in the 5-0 sweep of Alastair Cook’s England in 2013/14 which sparked the exits of a number of senior players and staff. England spinner Graeme Swann promptly retired after the third Test of that ill-fated series, while batsmen Michael Carberry and Kevin Pietersen were never seen again in Test whites. With Joe Root’s team having given back the urn and 3-0 down heading to the fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnson said selectors should make hard decisions now rather than wait until the end of the series. “Going to the next Test I think England will have to think about changes,” the 36-year-old said after training with Big Bash side Perth Scorchers at the WACA. “I‘m not sure if (paceman) Stuart Broad is up to it at the moment. There will be some question marks around him, (as) a senior player. “(Opener) Alastair Cook is someone who I think has been thinking about retirement. I just wonder now with the scoreline being 3-0 whether that will take a bit of pressure off him and he’ll just go out there and score runs. I‘m not sure.’’ – Reuters.
