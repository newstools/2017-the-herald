LONDON. — English Premiership soccer side Swansea City have named Carlos Carvalhal as their new manager until the end of the season with the option of an extension. The 52-year-old Portuguese was sacked by Championship side Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend after they lost to Middlesbrough. Carvalhal agreed the deal to take over at Swansea on Wednesday night and travelled to the club overnight to meet his new squad and take training on Thursday morning. His first game will be away to Watford tomorrow. Swans chairman Huw Jenkins said: “We are very pleased with the appointment. “We felt we needed to get the managerial situation resolved as soon as possible and while the timing is not always perfect, we can look forward to the second half of the campaign with renewed optimism. “Carlos’ time at Sheffield Wednesday, which included securing two consecutive play-off places, highlighted that he has great character and personality to lead the squad and the football club, which is vital at such a crucial time. “He has built up a lot of experience over the years which will ensure the team is structured and organised. He is driven and ambitious and while he has a big challenge ahead of him, I know he will tackle it without fear.” His task will be to keep the Swans in the Premier League. They sit bottom of the table with 13 points from 20 games, a record which cost previous manager Paul Clement his job earlier this month. Carvalhal has also managed Besiktas and Sporting Lisbon. — Sky Sports
