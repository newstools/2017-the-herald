Jose Mourinho MANCHESTER. – Jose Mourinho fears Romelu Lukaku has lost his pace because he has bulked up too much. Manchester United’s £75million striker has put on almost half a stone since joining from Everton last summer. Club doctors have assured Old Trafford boss Mourinho the extra weight is all muscle and not fat. But United are worried it has slowed down the 24-year-old. Lukaku had a great start to his United career, scoring 11 goals in his first 10 games. But since hitting the gym to improve his strength, the Belgian has gone through a dry spell, finding the net just once in his next 12 games. He then hit three in four but strangely refused to celebrate against Bournemouth and West Brom. After another three appearances without netting, some fans are losing patience with him. United have dropped seven points in their last five league games and trail leaders Manchester City by 15 points. And early this month, at the peak of Lukaku’s scoring slump, Mourinho told him he was simply not playing far enough forward. He explained to the powerhouse frontman he was fed up shouting that to him during games from the technical area and him not responding. Mourinho believed Lukaku was dropping deep in games to get involved when the chances were not coming his way. – The Sun.
