Adv Mudenda Margaret Matibiri and Joyce Mukucha PARLIAMENT on Tuesday donated two solar geysers, an industrial gas stove and a 40 litre gas tank to Bumhudzo Old People’s Home in Chitungwiza. The donation is part of proceeds from the charity golf day held by Parliamentarians in August as a way of raising funds for old people’s homes around the country. Speaker of the National Assembly Advocate Jacob Mudenda urged legislators to remember the elderly. “Members of Parliament receive money for constituency development,” he said. “They should in turn allocate a small amount to charity homes in their areas because the elderly are their responsibility. If they do not do so, next year in Parliament we will remind them that they have a debt to pay and they will be owing these charity homes.” Adv Mudenda applauded care-givers at Bumhudzo for working hard even though their remuneration was low. “Special mention goes to all the staff at this institution who are carrying the heavy burden of caring for our elderly,” he said. “Workers who are blessed with the capability of doing so with a loving heart. “Getting old is not a crime. It is the grace of the Lord and these elderly people deserve to live as comfortably as they can. I was briefed earlier that workers here are owed money. “It is not fair for anyone to work and not reap any rewards from it. We will make sure that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is engaged so that these workers get what they are owed and also that they can get their salaries monthly. Workers should be respected and given their dues.” The administrator for the home and The Salvation Army Church’s Major Chrisia Nyaruberu, applauded the efforts by parliamentarians to ensure that the elderly live comfortably. Bumhudzo Old People’s Home caters for 30 elderly people. It normally takes care of 110 elderly people, but reduced the numbers due to resource shortage. The home owes Chitungwiza Municipality $13 000 and it relies on well-wishers for survival.
