Fungai Lupande Senior Court Reporter A 32-year-old Harare man allegedly pushed a female reveller off a high veranda, fracturing her leg in the process, while attacking her for turning off the music in a beer hall. Trymore Mavhunga (32) of Tsuri Street Rugare in Harare appeared before magistrate Josephine Sande facing charges of assault. Ms Sande granted him $50 bail before remanding him to January 30. He was ordered to continue residing at his given address, not interfere with witnesses and investigations as part of his bail conditions. The court heard that the complainant Tarisai Zheke (33) of BF Nyashanu Street, Rugare in Harare resides in the same neighbourhood with Mavhunga. The prosecutor Mr Sabastian Mutizirwa alleged that on December 15 this year at around 9pm, Zheke was at Mashazhike Beerhall at Rugare shops. It is alleged that Mavhunga was also enjoying himself at the same bar and he started accusing Zheke of stopping the music. The court heard that Mavhunga advanced towards Zheke and grabbed her by the neck, in a bid to strangle her. He pushed her vigorously until she slipped and fell off the veranda, causing her leg to fracture. It is alleged that Mavhunga continued to charge towards Zheke and pressed her neck while she was on the ground, strangling her in the process. The court heard that another reveller restrained Mavhunga. After realising that he had caused serious injuries on Zheke, Mavhunga allegedly fled from the scene. Zheke was helped to report the matter to the police before being ferried to hospital for medical attention. It was confirmed that Zheke had sustained a fractured leg and a medical report is held as exhibit.
