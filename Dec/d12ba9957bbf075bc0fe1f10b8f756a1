Diamonds Fungai Lupande Senior Court Reporter Four Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) employees have appeared in court accused of conniving to smuggle fake diamonds into the company’s sorting house, replacing them with high quality diamonds thereby swindling the firm of half a million dollars. ZCDC diamond sorter Anesu Dhliwayo (34) today appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Rumbidzai Mugwagwa facing theft charges. He was remanded to tomorrow for bail consideration.
