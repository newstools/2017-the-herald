Mesut Ozil LONDON. — Mesut Ozil favours a move to Manchester United over Barcelona should he leave Arsenal in the coming months. Arsene Wenger confirmed this week that the Gunners are still negotiating with Ozil, whose contract runs down at the end of this season. A new deal worth £235 000 a week has already been turned down, with the Germany international making it plain to friends he is eyeing a switch to United. Ozil wants closer to £300 000 and Jose Mourinho has been watching his situation closely as the United boss plans an overhaul at Old Trafford. The 29-year-old would be open to a reunion with his old Real Madrid boss. The pair worked well together at the Bernabeu, with Ozil known to have quickly taken to Mourinho’s methods. United’s need for added attacking flair is evident, particularly after Sunday’s derby defeat by Manchester City, and Mourinho wants Ed Woodward to release the purse strings next summer. — Mailonline.
