Rtd Brig-Gen Gwanetsa Walter Mswazie Masvingo Correspondent ABOUT 500 families in Chiredzi South are facing food security challenges following the collapse of the 159 hectares Chilonga Irrigation Scheme after the water source changed its course. A visit to the irrigation scheme recently, home to 500 small-scale farmers working on 0,1 hectare plots each, revealed a gloomy picture. There is no longer activity at the scheme which used to be the breadbasket of Chiredzi town and parts of Mwenezi District through horticultural produce. Chiredzi South legislator Retired Brigadier-General Callisto Gwanetsa said the situation was unbearable. He urged Government to come to the villagers’ rescue as the scheme was the lifeblood for many people in his constituency. “We appeal to Government and well-wishers to help us change the river course back to its original route. The change of the river course, Runde River, was caused by the floods which hit the district 10 years go,” he said. Rtd Brig-Gen Gwanetsa said the scheme is one of the important sources of food for the drought prone district. “This is our biggest irrigation scheme in Chiredzi District. All horticultural produce for Chiredzi town was from this scheme. This irrigation is strategic and has proved to be the saviour for many villagers since its birth in 1964. About 500 families are gainfully dependent on Chilonga Irrigation Scheme that if the challenge of water is addressed we will all be happy.” Rtd Brig-Gen Gwanetsa said the submersible pump used to draw water from the Runde River was no longer able to pump water. “For the past 10 years the irrigation has been lying idle and it is hard to start planting basing on rainfed agriculture because we are in Natural Regions 4 and 5,” he said. Rtd Brig-Gen Gwanetsa said heavy siltation of the Runde River means there is need for heavy machinery to turn the river back on its course.
