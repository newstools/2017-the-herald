Problem Masau Arts Correspondent In a bid to preserve the rich Shona culture, Sweden-based cultural activist Luckson Chikutu has published a book titled “Flashback Identity”. The book which was published in Swedish is now being translated into English. Popularly known as Manlukerz in the entertainment industry, Chikutu says the book is a bridge between cultural and generational gap. “After a long period of persistent writing and endless patience, finally came the result, a book titled ‘Flashback Identity’. The writing of the book has been a long journey with positive insights I received and a high ambition to write about my family’s history, the cultural heritage I learnt when I was growing up. The book also captures how music and dance are used to influence humanity in Zimbabwe,” said Manlukerz. Manlukerz’s hope is that the book be used in schools to teach pupils about the rich cultural heritage of Zimbabwe. “I really want the book to be used in schools. This is my small contribution to Zimbabwe,” he said. The author is also a musician. “My mother taught me how to sing, dance, and play traditional music instruments. She also taught me how to use both the instruments and the musical tones to express emotions and feelings. The inspiration I got from my mother motivated me to spread my wings on to the traditional and contemporary music world,” he said. Manlukerz has continued with his performances in Sweden. He frequently conducts workshops in schools on Zimbabwe’s traditional music. He is also the founder of the annual Zimbabwe Music Festival Bira (Zimfebi) Zimfeb, which was formed in April 2007 is now an annual event. The festival’s objective is to bring people together through celebrating cultures from different parts of the world. It also aims to promote awareness through music.
