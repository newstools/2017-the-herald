LONDON. – Referees will have the power to abandon matches if racism takes place at next summer’s World Cup soccer finals in Russia. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said racism has been made a “high priority” and they are giving officials greater powers over incidents on the pitch and in the stadiums. Former Zenit St Petersburg forward Hulk, the Brazil international, has claimed racism is a regular occurrence in domestic games in Russia. Infantino said: “We’ll make sure that no incidents will happen and . . . we have for the first time in a World Cup the so-called, three-step procedure where a referee can stop a game or even abandon a game if there are discriminatory or racist incidences. “We will be very, very firm on that so we can expect fair play in Russia.” Fans are being warned there will be life bans and a zero tolerance policy employed during the tour- nament. Infantino also said that no final decision has been made on whether VAR will be used but goal line technology will be employed. He added: “I think it is absolutely normal that in 2018 we can explore and see how we can help the referee and the team to take the right decision. “So video assistant refereeing is a topic which will be decided in March of next year but the experience so far has been extremely positive to help the referee not to commit big mistakes which obviously as a human being he can do.” Meanwhile, FIFA has moved to reassure football fans it will not manipulate the World Cup draw tomorrow to favour certain teams. – The Mirror
