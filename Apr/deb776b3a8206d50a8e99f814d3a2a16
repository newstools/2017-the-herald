Antonio ConteLONDON. Antonio Conte is close to agreeing a new long term deal with Chelsea despite only taking over at Stamford Bridge last summer.The former Italy boss still has two years left to run on his contract but has impressed Roman Abramovich after leading the Blues to the verge of the English Premier League soccer title. It has been a remarkable turnaround for Chelsea who could move a step closer to their second League and FA Cup double if they beat Tottenham at Wembley later this month.Conte (47) earns around 5 million a season and will be rewarded with a huge pay raise of around 50 per cent to keep in West London for the next five years.He is a target for Inter Milan but is expected to move his family to London this summer after they remained in Italy during his first campaign in charge.Conte will finalise the deal as soon as Chelsea have secured their sixth domestic crown after seeking assurances that no first team stars will be sold this summer.As a result Abramovich will rebuff any World record offers that come from Real Madrid for Belgium play maker Eden Hazard or goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Meanwhile, Conte admitted Chelsea s shock 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace has blown the Premier League title race wide open.Conte s side went into Saturday s clash with relegation-threatened Palace sitting 10 points clear at the top of the table and having won their previous 13 fixtures at Stamford Bridge.But after goals from Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke fired Palace s stunning upset and second-placed Tottenham won at Burnley, Chelsea found their lead cut to seven points with nine games remaining.And Blues boss Conte conceded the battle is back on, with his players needing to bounce back when Manchester City visit Stamford Bridge in midweek.
