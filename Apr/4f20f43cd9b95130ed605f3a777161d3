Willard KatsandePetros Kausiyo Deputy Sports Editor AS the ABSA Premiership s 2016-17 season reaches its business end, Zimbabwe captain Willard Katsande has backed his countrymen to play more influential roles at their respective clubs in the battles for the championship and survival from relegation. Zimbabwe has 18 players who are plying their trade at 11 of the 16 clubs in the South African top-flight. There is no doubting the talent that is in Zimbabwean players and at times what just lacks is resources especially back home. But at whatever club they are I am proud that they play with determination and commitment, said Katsande.Katsande s Kaizer Chiefs are chasing glory on both ends, the championship and in the Nedbank Cup.Success in both competitions also guarantees continental football in the Champions League and Confederation Cup.He is one of three Zimbabweans at Amakhosi.Winger Edmore Chirambadare and striker Michelle Katsvairo are also at the Soweto giants, having arrived from Chicken Inn at the start of the current season.The cast of local players who are in the ABSA Premiership includes Warriors goalkeeper Tatenda Mukuruva who is at Cape Town City and Eric Chipeta who is on the books of Ajax Cape Town.Reigning South African Footballer of the Year and African Footballer of the Year runner-up Khama Billiat is the talisman at African champions Mamelodi Sundowns.The pair of left back Onismor Bhasera and striker Kingston Nkatha are with SuperSport United.Another Warriors striker Tendai Ndoro is the leading marksman at ninth-placed Orlando Pirates where he has so far struck 12 goals.Modest outfits Golden Arrows have the trio of Kuda Mahachi, Knox Mutizwa and Danny Phiri while Maritzburg United are being served by the pair of Blessing Moyo and Evans Rusike.Tall goalkeeper George Chigova, striker Walter Musona and gangly defender Carlington Nyadombo are on the books of Polokwane City.Ageless goalkeeper Tapuwa Kapini is leading from the back at 15th placed Highlands Park in their desperate fight against relegation I think hunger to succeed and determination is what really drives us. There is also this knowledge that the main reason why you are here in South Africa is to work for your family and get money and that I think also drives us as players. And, of course, for us as Zimbabweans we are known for being hard workers, Katsande said.Katsande revealed that he had also been playing a brotherly role to some of the younger players who have been joining the trek to South African clubs. Every player I give advice to I always tell them to work hard and improve and that they must always leave a mark each time they play, Katsande said.
