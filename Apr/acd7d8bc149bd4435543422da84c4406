Irrigation industry expert Edwin Mungure who is also Sales and Marketing manager at Almin Metal Industries said; the region needs to boost its irrigation infrastructure to make good use of its water bodies and to combat the effects of climate change. This comes as Government is in the process of establishing a National Mechanisation and Irrigation Authority of Zimbabwe to maximise the utilisation of the country s agricultural land and water resources to enhance food production and ensure the country attains self-sufficiencyMr Mungure was speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing Agritech International Expo in Chisamba, Zambia where nine Zimbabwean companies are showcasing their products and services under the umbrella of ZimTrade.Arthur Garden Engineering company representative Itayi Kureya said the recent rains which have necessitated a good harvest would open opportunities for engineering companies to supply agricultural equipment. The trend is that when the harvest is good, farmers always invest more in their processes and therefore this expo is a good chance to showcase the ingenuity of Zimbabwean engineering. We are receiving healthy inquiries particularly on our trademark AG4000 towed grader which is useful in making fire breaks and farm road maintenance, said Mr Kureya.This is the second year that ZimTrade is facilitating the participation of local firms at the highly acclaimed expo. Zimbabwe is the only African country which has a dedicated pavilion.Other international countries with pavilions include United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, France and China.ZimTrade Market Information manager, who is also the head of delegation, Christopher Tsimba said following on the successes of last year s expo Zimbabwe s prospects of supplying regional markets have been enhanced by the good rains received within the region. There has been a growing interest in irrigation equipment and we are hopeful that at the close of the expo tomorrow, companies who are exhibiting would have recorded good business leads. This year s Zimbabwean expo is complemented by demonstration plots from Agricura, Windmill and ZFC. Other local companies exhibiting at the expo include William Bain and Company Holdings, United Spring Forging Company, Arthur Garden Engineering, Mealie Brand and Fivet Animal Health.Mr Tsimba said the export promotion body will continue participating in regional trade fairs and expos to enable local companies to consolidate their export markets and to explore new opportunities.
