Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE National Paralympic Games scored a first yesterday when they got corporate partnership for the first time in the history of the Games. The Games will run from tomorrow until Monday in Mashonaland Central in various venues across Bindura. And yesterday the annual Games, through the initiative of the NPG fundraising committee, received a major boost when companies such as NMB Bank, ZimGold and PFK Chartered Accountants donated towards the hosting of the Games.What was more special about the contributions is that it is the first time that the Games have got help from partners.The Games solely relied on the Government grant and what the local organising committee would have gathered from the hosting province.Yesterday, the financial institution made a donation of 471 medals to be given to the athletes as well as 1 500 t-shirts.ZimGold Cooking Oil donated 1 500 litres of cooking oil, which is enough to cover the games budget requirements.The company also ensured that every athlete will take home a 2-litre bottle of cooking oil after the games.Some well-wishers also contributed towards the Games by providing 150 kilogrammes of peanut butter, 100 kilogrammes of tomatoes and toiletries for the athletes to use for the duration of the Games.NMB chief operating officer Gerald Gore said they saw the need to partner the Paralympics for a worthy cause. When we were approached, it was not a difficult decision for us, as a bank we believe we have an equally important mind and responsibility to the community which we do business with. Our attraction as a bank was to put a smile on someone s face, said Gore.The fundraising committee representative, Tafadzwa Mapanzure, promised the companies a return on their investment. We are grateful to the corporate world for having confidence in the team and responding to the clarion call. Some organisations managed to respond regardless of short notice. There are strategies in place to get a return on your investment, said Mapanzure.
