KINGSTON. Yasir Shah completed a six-wicket haul to spearhead the second innings rout of the West Indies as Pakistan achieved a comfortable seven-wicket victory just after lunch on the final day of the first Test cricket on Tuesday. Trailing on first innings by 121 runs and resuming at the overnight position of 93 for four, the home side were dismissed for 152 after less than two hours play at Sabina Park in Jamaica.Needing just 32 runs for a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series, the tourists lost three wickets either side of the interval and it was left to captain Misbah ul Haq to end Pakistan s abysmal run of six consecutive Test match defeats with consecutive sixes off Devendra Bishoo.Having taken the first four wickets late on the fourth evening, Shah was kept waiting for more success at the start of play on the fifth day as the visitors faster bowlers took up the challenge of continuing the demolition job by taking the next four wickets.However, the leg-spinner, who bowled unchanged from one end throughout the morning s play, was not to be denied another five-wicket innings haul.He wrapped up the innings with the wickets of tail-enders Alzarri Joseph and Shannon Gabriel in the space of four deliveries in his 22nd over, finishing with the excellent innings figures of six for 63 and a match haul of eight for 154. It was tough for me during the last series in Australia and I was happy to get back among the wickets here, he said after receiving the man-of-the-match award. AFP.
