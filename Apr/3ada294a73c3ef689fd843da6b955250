Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter SEASONED Northern Region Division One League campaigners Herentals continued with their flying start to the season when they ground out a 2-1 win over Darwin away at Pfura on Good Friday. Herentals are one of three early pacesetters who are yet to taste defeat since the start of the season.The others are leaders Ngezi Platinum U-19 and second placed Mushowani Stars.The three top teams all have nine points from three matches, but Herentals are only third because of an inferior goal difference.There is a strong belief, however, within the Herentals camp that this could be their season after they gave Black Rhinos a strong run for their money in last year s title challenge.With an attack led by the Majarira siblings Archmore and Blessing, coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva has had a reason to be upbeat about his team s chances.Blessing, who was the region s top goal scorer last season, has already taken his tally to three goals in as many matches.Herentals team manager Oliver Mataba praised his team for their results so far, but insisted they were not getting carried away. I think the players are starting to gel and the win is a strong message to our opponents. The team is playing fantastic football and our new players have managed to fit in well with former Gunners player Dezel Chimwemwe now commanding a first team jersey. Also doing well is ageless Innocent Benza who provided an assist for Archmore s goal. He is improving with each game despite his age Mataba, said Northern Region Results:Ngezi Platinum U-19 2, Karoi United 1; Golden Valley 6, Kariba Waves 0; Blue Swallows 7, Harare City Cubs 1; Mushowani Stars 2, ZRP Morris 0; Trojan 1, Banket 0; Darwin United 1, Herentals 2, Cranbone 3, Chegutu 0;
