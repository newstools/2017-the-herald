HOUSTON. The United States and China, two major countries in the world today, must keep good relations and strengthen their win-win co-operation as this will not only benefit the two countries, but also the whole world, some well-known Americans have said. Charles Foster, chairman of US-China Partnership and former chairman of Asia Society Texas Centre, Chase Untermeyer, former US Ambassador to Qatar and Neil Bush, the son and private representative to former US President George H.W Bush, shared the view that the US-China relations are the most important one in the world.In their interviews with Xinhua on Friday on the sideline of the 10th National Chinese Language Conference (NCLC) in Houston, Texas, the US dignitaries said such relations will have significant impacts on the two countries and the world as a whole. Meetings between the heads of state of China and the United States have always played a critical role in defining and maintaining this important bilateral relationship, no more so than today after a very bumpy start by President Donald Trump, Foster said. Chinese President Xi Jinping s meeting with President Trump indicates that both recognise the critical need to support and reinvigorate our most important bilateral relationship, he said.From his point of view, Houston has played a greater role in US-China policy than one might recognise. The world saw the iconic photo in 1979 when paramount Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping during his historic visit put on a 10-gallon Stetson hat at the Simonton Rodeo east of Houston, evidencing the huge change in US-China relations, Foster said. Deng Xiaoping opened China s very first Consulate General in the United States in Houston. By virtue of the fact that President George H.W Bush in 1974 served as one of our first envoys to our initial Liaison Office in Beijing, Bush established personal relations with key Chinese figures; those relationships served him well as vice president and president of the United States, he said.
