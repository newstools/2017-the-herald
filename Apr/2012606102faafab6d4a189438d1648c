Lovemore Chikova China-Africa Focus China has a population of more than 1,3 billion, yet the Communist Party of China (CPC) accounts for only 88 million members. The figures appear skewed until one realises the rigorous screening that one goes through to become a member of the CPC.One does not just wake up, go to the nearest party offices and obtain the membership card.In fact, the CPC admits members who have proven themselves to be equal to the task of serving the party in their communities.This has resulted in a leaner, but much more dedicated membership of the party.Although there are cases of indiscipline within the party from one or two elements, the majority of the CPC members follow strict disciplinary rules without flinching.This has resulted in the CPC being one of the strongest political parties in the world and is destined to remain so for a long time to come.During my recent stay in China, I interacted with various members of the CPC at different platforms.The impression I got is that the party s members are so dedicated to its cause to the extent that to some of them, the CPC is like a religion.I had an opportunity to interface with the CPC s deputy director-general for the Bureau of African Affairs International Department, Mr Wang Heming, who explained why this is so.Mr Wang said the progress made by the CPC in all facets of the Chinese society can be mainly attributed to the discipline of its members.Apart from the discipline, the party has managed to always connect its theories and ideology with its practices on the ground.In other words, the CPC has remained closely connected to the people and always considers criticism and self-criticism as important instruments of party building. Members must abide by the decisions of the Central Committee and after the final decision is made by the Central Committee the entire party members will implement it, said Mr Wang. That is why we have gained efficiency in national construction and development. Another factor that has ensured that the CPC continues to progress is its desire to serve the people and do so perfectly. Chairman Mao (Zedong) said we should consider the relations between the party and the people as to relations between the fish and the water, Mr Wang said. We all come from the people and we should remain and stay connected with the people. One of the principles of the CPC is to serve the people and it is more than a slogan; it is what we do, that is why we can get the support of the people for such a long time. The CPC has been able to weed out unwanted elements, especially those who engage in corrupt activities, through, in most cases, the imposition of long jail terms.Although there are such bad apples which manifest in the party from time to time, the CPC general membership has remained entirely loyal to uplifting its principles.This can be explained by how one gets to become a member.To the CPC, it is not about numbers, but the quality of membership, hence the long and arduous process followed in admitting a new member.The process of joining the party is sometimes seen as cumbersome by critics, yet it is meticulous and aimed at recruiting the correct candidates.Although there are foreigners who have joined the CPC, the basic rule is that one should first and foremost be a Chinese national for at least 18 years to be admitted.The prospective member should demonstrate willingness to implement the CPC s binding decisions and pay membership fees on time.The process of joining the CPC starts with an application being filed with the applicant s closest party committee or branch.The application letter, which should be handwritten, should explain why one is applying for membership of the party and why they believe in the CPC.The letter should also explain areas where the applicant thinks has weaknesses and falls short of the requirements to become a member.After the application is received, the applicant will have to go through courses on the party to learn its constitution, rules and regulations.The courses are examinable, and one has to pass the written tests emanating from what they would have learnt.After passing the examinations, the applicant is asked to provide more information to the party branch about themselves and their parents.In this case, the personal information can include one s employment status and their parents political orientation.If one goes through all this, they will then have to be put on at least one year s probation.This probation comes only if one passes the initial screening, is recommended by at least two party members and approved from the party branch.But wait a bit.Taking the probation does not mean a direct ticket to membership.One can be expelled even after completing the probation or have the probation extended if the officials think there is room for improvement.Those who do well and are highly recommended after their probation can be allowed to become full members of the CPC.To ensure loyalty and commitment, one has to take an oath in front of the party flag before being officially admitted as a member.The party constitution allows Central Committee or provincial party committees to admit new members directly, but only under special circumstances.Generally, members of the CPC are regarded as the vanguard of the Chinese society, from the working class in cities to peasants in the rural areas.The CPC respects the grassroots concept and as a result, every member, irrespective of position, should be organised into a branch, cell or other specific unit of the party to participate in its regular activities.The party members have the freedom to withdraw their membership if they want, although such cases are very few.In withdrawing the membership, the concerned member should notify their branch, which will discuss the withdrawal in its meeting.The name of the member is consequently removed from the register and the removal is made public.The branch then reports to the next party hierarchy about the withdrawal of the particular membership.The CPC was founded in 1921 and its organisation is generally at central, local and grassroots levels.Its central organs include the National Congress, Central Committee, Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee.The local organs are province, city and county.The grassroots organs are established within enterprises, rural areas, government offices, schools, scientific research institutions, residential communities, social groups, social intermediary agencies and other lower-level establishments.
