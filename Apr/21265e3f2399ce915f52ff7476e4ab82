AUGUSTA. &#8211; Australian golfer Jason Day completed a long weekend of practice at Augusta National on Sunday, hopeful his mother s condition in her cancer fight will allow him to play in the Masters. The world number three toured the famed layout for the third consecutive day ahead of Monday s first official practice session for what he hopes will be his seventh Masters start come Thursday.Day withdrew during the first round of the World Golf Championships Match Play event two weeks ago in Austin, Texas, and put his golf on hold to be with his mother, Dening, after her lung cancer surgery on March 24.She was treated at Ohio State University s cancer hospital and is resting in Columbus, Ohio, where Day and his family live. She s in good hands, Day said in comments to the Masters website, saying that gave him the peace of mind and confidence to return to golfing.While his workouts among the Georgia pine trees are a good sign he will play this week in the year s first major championship, he said that nothing is certain given his mother undergoing chemotherapy treatments. &#8211; AFP.
