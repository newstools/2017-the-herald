LIVERPOOL. Steven Gerrard is expected to take charge of Liverpool s Under-18s side from next season, as the former midfielder steps up his responsibilities in his boyhood club s youth system. Gerrard, who made a total of 748 appearances for Liverpool over the course of a 17-year-long stay at Anfield, returned to the club on a full-time basis earlier this year after bringing his playing career to an end last November.The 36-year-old has combined duties as a coach at the club s Kirkby-based academy with studies for his coaching badges and appearances as a television pundit for BT Sport.According to The Times, Gerrard s application and work ethic since taking on the role have impressed J rgen Klopp and academy director Alex Inglethorpe enough for him to be rewarded with a place in the dugout.Upon announcing his departure from Major League Soccer s Los Angeles Galaxy last year, Gerrard turned down an offer to manage League One outfit MK Dons.
