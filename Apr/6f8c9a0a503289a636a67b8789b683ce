AUGUSTA. Tommy Fleetwood is no one s favourite to win the 81st Masters golf title, but the understated 26-year-old Englishman with the flowing locks and the tidy short game won t let that get him down. Favourites have a habit of coming unstuck at the Masters and this year all eyes are on what the course holds for world number one Dustin Johnson, whose form puts him way ahead of all contenders here. But I have beaten him, boasts soft-spoken Fleetwood, who slid to around 200th in the world rankings last year before a run of superb results vaulted him inside the top 50 and earned him a place at the world s most elite golf tournament for the first time. He s getting good, that s for sure, joked Fleetwood of Johnson (32), who captured his first major title at last year s US Open at Oakmont, and has won three events in a row in the run up to Augusta: at Riviera in February and last month s WGC Mexico and the WGC Match Play in Texas. It s very, very impressive what he is doing, said Fleetwood. I think there s not been too many runs like he s had. I think Rory (McIlroy) did it when he won the Open and the PGA at Bridgestone. Tiger did it a few times. But he s in some pretty elite company at the moment with how he s playing. AFP.
