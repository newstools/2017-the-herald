The United States launched missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to retaliate a deadly chemical attack on civilians.The strikes pushed President Donald Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Syria s ally Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow.Also, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the US for a peaceful resolution with North Korea, which has warned it would launch a nuclear attack if provoked by the United States, as a US Navy strike group headed toward the western Pacific.The S&amp;P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average, while the price of gold and VIX, Wall Street s fear gauge, rose to their highest levels since November.At 10:57 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 52.9 points, or 0,26 percent, at 20,598.4, the S&amp;P 500 was down 7.27 points, or 0,31 percent, at 2,346.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 19.45 points, or 0,33 percent, at 5,847.32.Earnings are likely to be the next catalyst for the market.
