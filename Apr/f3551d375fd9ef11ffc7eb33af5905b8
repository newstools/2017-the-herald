The Castle Tankard horse race is the first ever sponsored horse race in Africa and it s no exaggeration that it remains the most prestigious horse race in Zimbabwe. The relationship with horse racing dates to around 1904, when the brand first played a significant role as an advertiser. For the first time consumers will participate in a promotion named Castle Tankard Experience and get a chance to win. The Castle Tankard has left a formidable mark to reckon with in our horse racing fraternity. It has stood the test of time and is growing bigger and better every year, said Nyandoroh.
