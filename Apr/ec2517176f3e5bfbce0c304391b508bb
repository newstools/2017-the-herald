I am disappointed with the result, we could have collected maximum points because we came back stronger in the second half despite conceding early again. I am just disappointed with Lloyd Mutasa. He has been around for a long time and I don t expect him to be leading his boys or to teach them wrong things . . . that s not a good example for Zimbabwean football. Referee Brighton Chimene then gave Triangle a lifeline when he awarded the home side a penalty in the 77th minute following a hand ball by a Dynamos player.Spot-kick specialist and goalkeeper Ronald Mudimu did not disappoint as he sent his opposite number Mateyaunga the wrong side.Mutasa was not amused with the draw and felt it was two points lost rather than a point gained after surrendering a two-goal cushion. We should have buried the game early in the first half when we dominated them and lapses of concentration from my boys cost us all the three points, Mutasa said. Teams:Triangle: R. Mudimu, R.
