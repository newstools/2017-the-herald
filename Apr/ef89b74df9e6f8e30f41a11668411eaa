LONDON. Former Arsenal striker Alan Smith says Arsene Wenger has to go because his players have got BORED with him. I think his time s reached its natural ending, said Smith, who won two titles, the FA Cup, League Cup and Cup Winners Cup with the Gunners. Some of the players have spent a long time listening to the same voice and I think it has become stale. Arsenal s become his life he gets up at six, he s at the training ground by 8am, he goes home at 6pm watches football and then comes back the next day and does it all over again. He s almost become institutionalised in the Arsenal life, and what happens on the inside of the club. But that s not a basis on which to make a decision (on a new contract). If he came out on the pitch, said I ve had a fantastic time but I m going to walk away in the summer he would go out as the legend that he is. And it would put a stop to all the poison and in-fighting among the fans. But if there s an offer of a contract there, he s probably thinking, why shouldn t I sign it? Wenger has been at the club 21 years. He thanked Gunners fans for their backing after Sunday s 2-2 draw against Manchester City on Sunday. The Daily Star.
