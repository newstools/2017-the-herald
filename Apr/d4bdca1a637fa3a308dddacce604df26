CHAMPAGNE STUFF . . . Mercedes British driver Lewis Hamilton celebrates with champagne on the podium after winning the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai yesterday. AFPSHANGHAI. Lewis Hamilton is braced for the closest fight of his Formula One career after drawing level on points with Sebastian Vettel following his victory in the Chinese Grand Prix yesterday. Avenging his defeat to his Ferrari rival in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Hamilton completed the third Grand Slam of his F1 career as he secured what was ultimately a comfortable victory at Shanghai.But the story of the race could have been very different but for an unfortunate strategy decision from Ferrari when they called in Vettel under the Virtual Safety Car on the second lap only for the call to backfire &#8211; relegating the German to sixth &#8211; when the full Safety Car was deployed moments later. We were matching times, said Hamilton after Vettel fought back to second place with outstanding moves past team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo. If there wasn t a Safety Car it would ve been much closer. It s going to be one of the closest, if not the closest, fights I ve experienced. Nor has Vettel s confidence for the rest of the season been undimmed by his defeat in China. In terms of pace we had a kind of match with Lewis, sometimes I was quicker, sometimes he was, the Ferrari driver told reporters.After edging out Vettel for pole position, Hamilton delivered a masterclass of front running to claim his 54th Formula 1 victory. Lewis on his day is in a different league. On a difficult day and difficult conditions there s nobody else I d rather have in the car, eulogised Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. Sky Sports
