The show was aimed at familiarising fans with his latest album Chikwama Changu which is his first release since his departure from the 3rd Generation Band.Speaking to The Herald Review, Baba Harare s manager Voyage Dambuza said they had embarked on promotional shows aimed at taking his album to the people. The band will also hold free shows at popular hangouts around the country. We want people to know that Baba Harare is not stopping at anything. He is strong as a brand and all he needs is appreciation from his fans so we are giving them free shows at popular hangouts. We will be back again next Saturday before we proceed to Zindoga in Waterfalls, Dambudza said. Our aim is to get the album to the people because it was released in January when people didn t have money which made it a bit difficult to push. Now it seems to be the right time for the brand to be accustomed to fans and we are doing everything we can to get it to music fans, he added.Baba Harare with his band City Vibration performed songs off Chikwama Changu album.
