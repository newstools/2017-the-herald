Abigail Mawonde Herald Correspondent The Zimbabwe Union of Drivers and Conductors (ZUDAC) has bemoaned the recent introduction of a presumptive tax on commuter omnibuses by Government, saying it could trigger a hike in targets by operators, putting pressure on drivers. Commuter omnibus operators will now pay $45 per vehicle in presumptive tax.According to a Government Gazette of March 24, informal traders like commuter omnibus operators, hairdressers and cross border traders are expected to pay a monthly presumptive tax. The presumptive tax chargeable in terms of Section 36C of the Taxes Act shall be in the case of . . . (e) operators of omnibuses for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward having seating accommodation for not less than 15 or more than 24 passengers, 45 dollars per month for each such omnibus operated. ZUDAC chairperson Mr Fradreck Maguramhinga yesterday said the tax would affect their operations in a big way. As ZUDAC we are not in support of the introduction of this new tax that Government has imposed on kombis. We have so many other monies being paid to enable us to operate on a day-to-day basis, hence the introduction of this tax will increase the burden, he said.Mr Maguramhinga said it was not fair to continue taxing operators without providing a conducive environment for them to operate. We do not have proper ranks in town and passengers end up going to the mshikashika vehicles while kombis lose customers, he said. For those kombis following the correct channel of being in the ranks, they rarely have three trips a day, which is not sustainable. When the time comes for us to pay the taxes, the money is hardly adequate to do so. We were not going to have problems with the tax if we were operating on an even ground, he said.
