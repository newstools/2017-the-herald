Jonathan Ralph Kadurira with friend Munyaradzi JokomoTafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter The secret of getting ahead is getting started, goes the adage. With that in mind, all is set for the music and talk session dubbed The Mesh to be held at Caf Aroma in Avondale today.The inaugural event is hosted by motivational speaker and author Ralph Kadurira, to cultivate good networks among young adults in terms of business and social relations through music and dialogue.The event will see Botswana author and inspirational speaker Tariro Anifasi and Kadurira taking part while live music will be provided by Slick outfit and popular Afro-fusion crew BlackSide.In an interview, Kadurira said all was set for the show as tickets had already started selling with some celebrities confirming their attendance. The Mesh is a fusion of live music, food and constructive dialogue. Amongst very few within the city, it uses music and dialogue not only to provide a platform, but also seeks to cultivate a good networking web for young adults in terms of business and social relations.It is meant to create a relaxed environment in which young people can meet, interact and share ideas, he said.Kadurira said in a society where everything is changing day in day out, motivation is important because it provides the drive for people to accomplish their goals, maintain their responsibilities or solve problems. Motivation can be created or re-sparked by looking at one s goals, assessing the stakes of achieving those goals and creating milestones as well as personal rewards for gaining progress, he said.He said he chose to use music and dialogue on the session because both of them have the power to shape a society. According to author Kristian David Olson, music is an important and extremely useful tool in the way we learn and to deny its power is a waste of a truly wonderful resource.Though some would look at music as a small footnote in the progression of humanity, it is in fact a much greater force; for some, it defines their very existence, he said.The event is sponsored by Springtide Morphoos and The Hive.Recently Kadurira made headlines at the Business and Career Indaba hosted by Harare East District UMYF where he touched on youth and business and how to identify one s inner circle.He is the author of such books which includes, Mind Blowers and Fighting Ignorance among others which have been used in different motivational dissertations by youths in music, fashion and business.
