LONDON. &#8211; John Terry will leave Chelsea at the end of the season after an illustrious 22-year career at Stamford Bridge, the English Premier League soccer leaders announced on Monday. The 36-year-old, who has not made a Premier League appearance since November, has signalled his desire to continue his playing career elsewhere next season, though a source told ESPN no MLS teams are interested in signing him.But Chelsea say they anticipate Terry will one day return to Stamford Bridge in a non-playing capacity, when he will be able to share his unparalleled experience with players, staff and fans alike. Announcing the decision, Terry told the club s official website: After 22 years there is so much to say and so many people to thank at this great football club. From coaches, teammates and staff to the fans who have given me so much support down the years, I can t thank you enough. There will be opportunities for me to speak further about this over the coming weeks. I will decide on my future in due course, but for now I am committed to helping the team achieve success this season. The club and I have always had a fantastic relationship, which will continue beyond my playing days. - ESPN.
