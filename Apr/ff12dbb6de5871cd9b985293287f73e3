Manny PacquiaoMANILA. Philippine world boxing champion Manny Pacquiao is to fight undefeated Jeff Horn on his home turf in Australia, the Filipino star s camp said yesterday. The announcement of the July bout ends months of speculation on who the 38-year-old Filipino dubbed Pac-Man would face next as he seeks to prolong a stellar career that saw him win world titles in eight different weight classes. We signed the Jeff Horn contract this morning. Fight is July 2 in Brisbane, Australia, Pacquiao s adviser Michael Koncz said.Koncz said Pacquiao would be staking his World Boxing Organization welterweight crown against Horn (29).He declined to say what the prize money would be.Pacquiao s American promoter Bob Arum had been originally pushing for the Filipino to face Horn in Australia but in a surprise development, Pacquiao and British boxer Amir Khan announced separately in February that they would fight on April 23.But the deal spectacularly fell through with Arum describing the reported $38 million United Arab Emirates fight to the Los Angeles Times as pie in the sky .After Horn, Koncz said he was still hoping to set up a Pacquiao fight with Khan in either the Middle East or the Philippines in October or November.Pacquiao, who has been hailed as a virtual national hero in his home country, briefly retired early last year and then ran and won a seat in the Philippine senate. But the retirement was short-lived as Pacquiao, who said he missed the ring, made a successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas in November. AFP.
