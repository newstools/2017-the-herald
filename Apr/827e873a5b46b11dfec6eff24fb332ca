OVER the past two days, the comatose opposition has been stirring with an eye on Election 2018. The first twitch was manifest in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the MDC-T and National People s Party led by Morgan Tsvangirai and Joice Mujuru. This was followed 24 hours later by a second twitch, another MoU between the MDC-T and Welshman Ncube s MDC.Details of the MoUs were not immediately released to the public but the significance of the pacts was evident in the indifference that followed their consummation.The MoUs hardly registered on the public Richter scale, which is why the Mbudzi jokes retained supremacy rather than news of the coming together of Mujuru, Tsvangirai and Welshman Ncube in a coalition against Zanu-PF.What this means is the envisaged opposition coalition can be likened to the proverbial tale told by a fool, which is full of sound and fury yet signifies nothing.And it is not difficult to understand why the opposition coalition is akin to the feverish mating of a gay couple that does not bring forth offspring.While the previous day the Government, as instructed by Zanu-PF had filled different venues countrywide as people gathered to celebrate 37 years of independence and democracy; Tsvangirai and Mujuru chose to meet 24 hours later to badmouth that same national convergence claiming there was nothing to celebrate as it was not yet Uhuru oblivious to the fact that it was the same independence they were trashing that fostered the democracy that enabled them to be and dream of 2018.And by repudiating our independence, Mujuru and Tsvangirai divorced themselves from the most important coalition that matters in politics, a convergence with the nation s founding values and hence its people.This is the coalition that matters to Zanu-PF, the coalition which has seen the ruling party remain invincible even in the face of a sustained attack on our economy by the Anglo-Saxon alliance to whom Tsvangirai and Mujuru were quick to extend a begging bowl.We reiterate, the real coalition that matters does not entail putting pen to paper, but is about the national interest, identifying, defending and promoting it through a shared vision with the Zimbabwean electorate.This is lost to Tsvangirai who cut his political teeth as a Western Trojan horse conceived as a knee-jerk reaction to Government s decision to embark on the fast-track land reform programme.This is lost to Joice Mujuru who should have learnt from Tsvangirai s folly, but has instead repeatedly repudiated not only the liberation struggle, but even her husband s memory given that the late Retired General was a top guerilla commander.And it can t even be found in Welshman Ncube, who has failed to transform himself from a regional to a national politician.And this why we believe President Mugabe was spot on when he likened the envisaged opposition coalition to a string of zeroes that even if added together can only amount to a zero.Until and unless the opposition parties coalesce with the national interest, they can sign MoUs till the cows come home but will always wake up in the opposition.
