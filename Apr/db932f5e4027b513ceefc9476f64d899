NeymarMADRID. &#8211; Barcelona made light of the suspended Lionel Messi s absence to remain just two points behind Spanish La Liga soccer leaders Real Madrid as Neymar netted his 100th goal for the club in a 4-1 win at Granada on Sunday. Earlier, Madrid consolidated their advantage at the top thanks to goals from Karim Benzema, Isco and Nacho to beat Alaves 3-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu.Madrid still also have a game in hand and the two will meet at the Bernabeu in three weeks time. The games after an international break are always special because the players travel a lot and accumulate tiredness, said Barca boss Luis Enrique. Playing away from home makes it even more difficult, but we overcame those problems very well. Enrique also paid tribute to his squad s strength in depth after they won 4-1 at Granada on Sunday without suspended talisman and La Liga top scorer Lionel Messi to stay on the heels of leaders Real Madrid.The coach rested centre backs Gerard Pique and Samuel Umtiti and started without captain Andres Iniesta but Barca claimed the points thanks to a tremendous display from Luis Suarez and an impressive showing by little-used striker Paco Alcacer. &#8211; AFP.
