Cde HungweTalent Hwari and Tatenda Charamba Government, together with private partners on Monday signed three Memoranda of Understanding for psychomotor projects in a bid to develop and enhance the skills of youths and disadvantaged groups. The projects include a fish farming project with the Zimbabwe Democratic Teachers Union, Highfields Psychomotor project with International Pharmacotherapy Education and Research Initiative (IPERI) and a techno-preneurship project with Society for Engineering Technologies in Africa (SETA).Speaking during the signing ceremony held in Harare, Minister of State for Psychomotor Activities in Education Josiah Hungwe said the signing of MoUs was the initial step that would result in the projects succeeding. Now that we have signed these agreements, it is time for us all to get into a fast forward gear and get visible projects going on the ground, he said.Minister Hungwe said the projects were going to be implemented nationwide. Let me remind our partners that this department is not for Harare only and, therefore, whatever project you have started here should quickly be replicated across the country, he said.Minister Hungwe said education had changed in that it was no longer just about thinking, but being able to implement skills that one possessed. The big question that one is asked when they say they are educated is: what can you do? he said. That is what education is about in Zimbabwe. Our business is about making sure that people are able to do things. Speaking at the same occasion, Deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Ray Ndhlukula said practical subjects needed to be taken seriously. Practical subjects have always been looked down upon resulting in poor uptake, he said. This calls for re-orientation of the society on the way it perceives these practical subjects since they are just as important as the other subjects.
