He has one and a half years left on his contract I don t see what s new, Wenger told the media yesterday ahead of Arsenal s clash with West Ham at the Emirates. We are professional football people. Our job is to perform as long as were somewhere. When I sign a contract I commit to it until the final day. I do not understand the anxiety. It s denying what the professional guy is about.
