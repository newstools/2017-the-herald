Vongai Mbara Arts Reporter Mt Zion music producer Temptation T-man Chirenje is set for a national tour where he will scout for new talent outside Harare. The mobile recording tour is scheduled to start mid-month and T-man will explore places like Chinhoyi, Mutare, Bindura and Kariba amongst others.Speaking in an interview, T-man said he was driven to do this tour by the many talents in Zimbabwe that are not yet discovered. It is all about searching new talent around Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has a lot of talented people who are disadvantaged by lack of resources, he said.T-man also said that this tour would help in expanding the music industry. If we want our industry to grow big, we need to help each other. I cannot do it alone nor can Harare do it alone but Zimbabwe as a whole which is why I am involving many cities in this tour, so that our industry will grow. T-man has become a household name that has worked with a lot of artists across all genres.His mobile recording tour could be the best strategy in assisting musicians based in remote areas who do not have equal opportunities with those in major cities.
