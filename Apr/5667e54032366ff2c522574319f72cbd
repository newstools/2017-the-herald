Bengaluru. Gold prices held firm yesterday after falling as much as 1 percent the previous day, with tension surrounding North Korea and the upcoming French presidential election driving safe-haven demand amid a firmer dollar. Spot gold was mostly unchanged at $1 278,64/oz at 3.46am GMT. The metal fell 0,8 percent on Wednesday in its worst one-day drop in more than a month. Sentiment overall is that everybody is looking for $1 300 at least by the end of the week. Sentiment around geopolitical issues is really playing on people s minds, said Spencer Campbell, general manager with Kaloti Precious Metals in Singapore. We are seeing a lot more physical purchasing, with shops seeing a 100 percent increase in buying from the retail sector. This clearly shows the pull back is an opportunity to buy gold before it climbs above $1 300, said Campbell.Analysts and traders said gold would be supported by simmering geopolitical tension around North Korea and nervousness ahead of the first round of France s presidential election. With this weekend s French presidential vote event risk, it is hard to see gold forming a meaningful correction to the downside before next week at the earliest, said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda.
