Tinashe Makichi Motoring Land Rover has revealed the new Discovery Sport, the world s most versatile premium compact SUV, and the first member of the new Discovery family. The Discovery Sport s progressive design sets the tone for a new generation of Land Rover Discovery premium SUVs. None of the new SUV s on the market, like the Chevrolet Trailblazer, have gotten close to offering what the Discovery sport offers and it still stands as a market leader. On home soil, we have a few of these on the road and the availability of financing and extended warranty being offered by the brand will surely improve sales.Here is a bit on the vehicle which will get you to appreciate it more and get a sense and a clear view of what sheer luxury really means.These vehicles will be positioned in the Leisure family of Land Rover s three-pillar brand architecture: Luxury (Range Rover), Leisure (Discovery) and Dual-Purpose (Defender).Its striking interior architecture offers high levels of superior quality materials.Uniquely in its segment, Discovery Sport s dynamic design combines 5+2 seating configurability with design and engineering integrity in a compact footprint.A suite of Land Rover innovations debut, including the next generation multi-link rear axle, an all-new touchscreen infotainment system and state-of-the-art high-strength steel and lightweight aluminium body shell for outstanding performance, safety and efficiency.This beautifully proportioned vehicle brings a new sense of dynamism to the Discovery family and projects an image of confidence with its wheel-at-each-corner stance.This streamlined design is complemented by class-leading usability: all-round visibility is excellent, whilst the interior and load space are easily accessible and fully optimised.Its versatile interior has been designed to be premium, not precious. The centre console forms a strong vertical graphic in the middle of the instrument panel; ensuring key controls are deliberately placed to provide easy access from the Sport s Command Driving Position. Simple, clean surfaces and high-quality materials feature throughout.A range of four-cylinder turbocharged petrol and turbo diesel engines is available. All feature stop-start technology, high-pressure direct injection, low-friction internal components and smart regenerative charging for outstanding performance and economy.Petrol derivatives use an all-alloy Si4 2,0-litre engine with 177kW and direct fuel injection.This offers six-cylinder levels of performance in a compact package that reduces weight and cuts carbon dioxide emissions by up to 20 per cent, compared to conventional larger capacity engines with a similar power output.The 2.2-litre turbo diesel derivatives are available in either 110kW TD4 or 140kW SD4 specification. With both TD4 and SD4 producing the same 420Nm, drivers can count on exceptional fuel efficiency, as well as effortless overtaking ability.All engine derivatives are mated to an advanced ZF 9HP48 nine-speed automatic transmission, for peerless refinement, efficiency, driver engagement and off-road capability. Discovery Sport models are available with Land Rover s legendary full-time four-wheel-drive system, to provide an unrivalled combination of on-road agility and off-road capability.Land Rover s Terrain Response system also features on all derivatives, allowing drivers to tailor Discovery Sport s responses to the prevailing conditions. Up to five settings are available: General; Grass/Gravel/Snow; Mud and Ruts; and Sand. Dynamic mode is optionally available and heightens on-road performance and driver feedback.It features cutting-edge technology to maximise both safety and convenience. New developments include everything from an advanced new infotainment system with 8-inch touchscreen to a pedestrian airbag that minimises the consequences of a collision.Customers can choose from 12 exterior colour ways: Fuji White, Santorini Black, Corris Grey, Indus Silver, Loire Blue, Scotia Grey, Aintree Green, Kaikoura Stone, Firenze Red, Yulong White, Barolo Black and Phoenix Orange. Whatever colour you love be it for a male or female customer, you will be catered for.Offering further differentiation, the Black Pack emphasises the vehicle s sporting appearance, with a gloss-black grille, door mirror caps, front fender vents, bonnet and tailgate lettering and a choice of eye-catching 19- or 20-inch alloy wheels.To achieve further distinction, a contrast roof extends to the base of the A-pillars and is available in either Santorini Black or Corris Grey. So if you want exclusivity and to be separated from the rest of the pack, the Black Pack will make you stand out.It s priced higher than the Defender and lower than the premium tiered Range rover products.
