LONDON. When Chelsea s team sheet materialised showing Eden Hazard and Diego Costa on the bench for Saturday s FA Cup semi-final it seemed Antonio Conte had handed the initiative to his Tottenham Hotspur counterpart Mauricio Pochettino. By the end of the match, with Chelsea celebrating an enthralling 4-2 victory at Wembley, the Italian looked like a genius.It was one of those days when everything he tried worked wonders and the nature of the win can surely propel Chelsea to the Premier League and FA Cup double.It was dynamic Brazilian Willian, largely a fringe player this season but who started in place of Belgian dangerman Hazard, who twice put Chelsea ahead with a sublime early free kick and a penalty, only for Spurs to twice level through Harry Kane and Dele Alli.
