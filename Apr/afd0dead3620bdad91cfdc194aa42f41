BILLERBECK. Whether he will find Easter eggs does not play an important role for him. Much more important would be balls. They are at customs, says Helmut Martin. One of the many small imponderables that the 67-year-old has to deal with when he is on the earth globe as a handball development assistant. The Billerbecker is currently sitting on packed suitcases again: This week it is going to Zimbabwe for two weeks in the south of the African continent.It is the second attempt to teach sport in the framework of the Handball at school programme of the International Handball Federation s International Handicrafts Association, to teach teachers in Zimbabwe. Three years ago I was already starting, recalls Martin. But then the handball president of Zimbabwe was dismissed in the short term and the trip two days before canceled. This time everything should work. I am in very close contact with the people in charge, he smiles. My contact person in Zimbabwe has even taken the B license in Leipzig. Last night it starts. From M nster to Frankfurt, then to Johannesburg in South Africa and again over 1 000 kilometres back to the capital Harare because there is no direct flight. He will be on the road for about 16 hours, but Helmut Martin, who is scheduled to arrive in Zimbabwe tomorrow, knows what he is doing. Allgemeine Zeitung.
