The dollar index edged up, but was hovering near a three-week low on disappointing US housing starts data and nervousness over trade talks between the US and Japan.In France, investors remained nervous ahead of the first round of the country s presidential election this Sunday, even though an opinion poll put centrist Emmanuel Macron first, just ahead of far-right, anti-euro candidate Marine le Pen.
