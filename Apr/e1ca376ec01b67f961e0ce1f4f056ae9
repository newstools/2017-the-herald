Now, therefore, we the undersigned members of the provincial executive council willingly and voluntarily appended our signatures in support of the above mentioned ouster of Cde Saviour Kasukuwere, reads part of the petition.In a letter addressed to the party s national secretary for administration Cde Ignatius Chombo, the province said it was supposed to hold its Provincial Coordinating Committee soon to endorse the decision.However, since the party had already received overwhelming support of 38 out of 50 executive committee members supporting the ouster of Cde Kasukuwere, the PCC meeting would just be an academic exercise.The Zanu-PF Harare provincial executive council on Saturday also passed a no-confidence vote on Cde Kasukuwere and Harare provincial commissar Cde Shadreck Mashayamombe in a day of high drama that witnessed skirmishes at the ruling party s provincial headquarters.Three people sustained head injuries and broken arms as party supporters sympathetic to Cdes Mashayamombe and, Cde George Mashavave (provincial secretary for administration) ran amok in the city.Cde Mashavave was among the provincial leaders who called for the ouster of Cdes Kasukuwere and Mashayamombe, respectively.Police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Paul Nyathi confirmed the skirmishes.Our sister paper, The Sunday Mail reports that police briefly detained Cde Mashayamombe for allegedly instigating the disturbances.On the same day, 28 Harare provincial executive members appended their signatures to a petition calling for the dismissal of Cdes Kasukuwere and Mashayamombe over a raft of allegations, including plotting to topple President Mugabe and insulting First Lady and Women s League Secretary Amai Grace Mugabe. The Zanu-PF constitution says a motion of no-confidence can be passed by a simple majority of an organ s members. The PEC has 50 members.The Harare and Mashonaland West provinces petition will be submitted to the Zanu-PF national leadership in keeping with the party s disciplinary code.Announcing the no-confidence vote, provincial secretary for administration Cde Mashavave said the petition was in accordance with Article 29 (section 251) of Zanu-PF s constitution.
