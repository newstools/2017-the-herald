LONDON. &#8211; With no question marks over his health or motivation, former world heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has no plans to bring the curtain down on his 21-year professional career and is relishing the pressure ahead of his title fight against Briton Anthony Joshua. Klitschko, who went unbeaten for 11 years before losing to Tyson Fury in 2015, has 64 wins against four defeats and will be hoping to seize Joshua s IBF heavyweight crown as well as the vacant WBA and IBO titles also up for grabs. Hopefully, I have a couple of years left in me, the 41-year-old Ukrainian told British media. I was always saying health and motivation is very important. If one of those things is missing then it doesn t make sense to continue. Klitschko will face Joshua on Saturday in front of a 90 000 strong crowd at Wembley, one of the largest crowds in British boxing. In regards to pressure, it s just enjoyable. Anthony Joshua is a great fighter, I m taking on the best out there to be the best. It s challenging . . . My next stage is bigger than my last, Klitschko said. The attention for the previous fight was less compared with this. It is an upgrade, it is a winning upgrade. I love it. Klitschko has severely criticised a host of British boxers for what he calls their lack of respect for the heavyweight division.Klitschko, who lost his world titles last year to Tyson Fury after 9 years as champion, takes on another Briton in Joshua in a title fight at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night.The Ukrainian hopes the contest will restore dignity to the sport following what he believes was unacceptable behaviour from the British heavyweights Fury, David Haye, Dereck Chisora and Dillian Whyte. &#8211; Reuters.
