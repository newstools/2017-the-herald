Sports Reporter TWO of the Castle Lager Premiership newboys punched above their weight to win priceless points on the opening weekend of the Castle Lager Premiership while another newly-promoted team, Black Rhinos, came within just a minute of getting a point in Mhondoro. However, Shabanie Mine and Yadah Stars went the distance and were full value for their points as they held champions CAPS United and ambitious Harare City.When Yadah Stars president Prophet Walter Magaya declared that his men would compete in the top-flight league, a lot of analysts dismissed him but, if they can play as well as they did at the National Sports Stadium on Saturday, they will surprise a number of the perennial campaigners.PLAYER OF THE WEEK Leeroy Mavhunga (Yadah Stars)Teenage forward Leeroy Mavhunga has been hailed as one of the brightest football prospects in this country by those who have followed his progress since he first started making a big impression in the colours of Malborough High School whom he captained to the NASH Under-17 Cup success and was voted player of the tournament.And, on Saturday, in his first game in the Castle Lager Premiership, Mavhunga who has been called into the Young Warriors squad in the past justified all the buzz around him with a polished and stylish display as he made a mockery of his markers with his dribbling artistry, a sudden burst of pace and maturity beyond his age. After initially struggling to impose himself on the game, in his team s match against Harare City, while playing on the right side, he moved to the left flank and he began to make a mockery of his seasoned markers, running rings around them and creating chances for his teammates that were not taken.In a league, and country, crying out for raw exciting talent, Mavhunga could be one of those who can answer those prayers and, while they say one swallow doesn t make a summer, his coach believes he is the real deal.TEAM OF THE WEEK Chicken InnShabanie Mine s brave performance to hold champions CAPS United to a draw at Maglas was a very good show but Chicken Inn s five-goal thrashing of Bantu Rovers was a class act and the Gamecocks deserve the tag for team of the week after their superb show on the opening weekend of the Premiership.Rahman Gumbo has always maintained that his critics should judge him this season, after he has spent a lot of time with the Gamecocks, and is his men can fire as well as they did on Saturday, they could prove a force this year.Some critics will say, of course, Bantu Rovers are the weakest side but hammering them for five goals won t be an easy job unless you have the quality.COACH OF THE WEEK Taku Shariwa (Shabanie Mine)The last time he faced CAPS United his team, Mutare City, crashed to a four-goal whipping in August last year but Taku Shariwa, who is now in charge of Shabanie Mine, helped his new team to stop the champions at Maglas yesterday.For a team that is still struggling for resources, Shariwa produced a technical master-class to turn them into one that could compete against the champions and, on another day, could have won this match.HEROES OF THE WEEK The FansFrom Harare to Zvishavane, thousands of fans flocked to the stadiums to watch the start of the domestic Premiership with the numbers clearly bigger than what we saw at the first weekend last year.
