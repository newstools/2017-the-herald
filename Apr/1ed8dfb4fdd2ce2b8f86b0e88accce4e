Manyande had earlier been booked for a foul on Mudzingwa.Shabanie, who had a brilliant first half, held on to the lead, giving their departing coach Wilson Mutekede a perfect farewell as he now assumes the ZIFA technical director s position. I m happy that we managed to get four points in our opening two games. We had a good game, especially in the first half where we could have buried about four chances, but we were wasteful. Second half we had to calm the boys nerves, with the turning point being when Highlanders were given a red card. At that point the game evened up and the boys began to believe that we could win the game and we got the goal, said Mutekede.It was a deserved victory for Shabanie, who went pound for pound with Bosso.The Zvishavane side were unlucky not to take an early lead in the second minute when the cross bar denied Maziwisa with Sibanda cleanly beaten.Maziwisa coolly controlled a cross from Collin Duhwa, but his shot hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced back into play before Highlanders cleared their lines. Maziwisa, Duhwa, Farai Mupasiri and Charles Makoto were first on the ball and gave Highlanders a torrid time in the early stages of the match.Bosso s first chance fell to Rodrick Mutuma in the 19th minute, but he went for the kill with his weaker left foot and Shabanie goalkeeper Samuel Mafukidze tipped the ball over for a corner.Two minutes later, Mutuma blew a golden opportunity, shying away from responsibility by trying to pass the ball to Prince Dube instead of going for goal.Bosso goalkeeper Sibanda pulled off a reflex save from an equally good attempt by Mupasiri, who had beaten his marker. Mupasiri shot ferociously at goal and Sibanda tipped the ball around the upright. Highlanders were left hard done by a bogus offside call by first assistant referee Thomas Kusosa, denying Mutuma a genuine goal.Highlanders coach Erol Akbay said: We played some good football, but failed to score. We lacked the final pass and the red card affected our tactical plans.
