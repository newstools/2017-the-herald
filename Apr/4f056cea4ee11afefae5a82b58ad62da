WEST BROMWICH. Roberto Firmino fired Liverpool to a 1-0 victory at West Bromwich Albion yesterday that moved Jurgen Klopp s men back into third place in the English Premier League soccer table. West Brom created the best chances in a largely uneventful first half before Firmino nodded home Lucas s flick on to register his 11th league goal of the season just before the break.The visitors could have extended their lead after halftime but James Milner blazed a glorious opportunity over the bar and Divock Origi had a goal ruled out for offside.Simon Mignolet made a crucial late save to deny Matt Phillips but, as West Brom piled on the pressure in the closing stages, Alberto Moreno missed an open goal after Ben Foster had come up for a corner.Liverpool have 66 points from 33 games, although they have played one more game than Manchester City who sit two points adrift in fourth. West Brom, meanwhile, lie eighth with 44 points. If you come away to West Brom you know what to expect and you must deal with it, Mignolet told Sky Sports. We are very pleased with the performance and the three points is massive today. You feel the pressure after you see the other teams and their results but we have to look at ourselves and do our jobs. After Manchester City were impressive 3-0 victors against Southampton on Saturday, Liverpool needed to respond in kind against a West Brom side who are notoriously strong at home.And Firmino settled a scrappy game with a close-range header in first half stoppage-time to condemn Albion boss Tony Pulis to his first ever home league defeat against the Reds.The Brazilian converted a flick-on from Lucas Leiva to seal a fifth win in their last seven games for Liverpool.They are unbeaten since losing at Leicester in late February and now lead fourth-placed Manchester City by two points, although Pep Guardiola s team have a game in hand in the race for an automatic spot in the Champions League group stage.West Brom had the first opening when Liverpool failed to clear their lines and Matt Phillips picked up possession on the edge of the area.He struck a shot that deflected to Hal Robson-Kanu but the Wales forward could not react quickly enough to turn it home.Liverpool began to dominate possession but Phillips tried his luck again with an ambitious effort from distance that went high and wide.However, Liverpool should have led on 15 minutes when they pounced on a hesitation from Claudio Yacob in the West Brom midfield, stole possession and broke with pace.Lucas fed Philippe Coutinho, who burst into the area and hit a cross-shot that flew narrowly wide of Ben Foster s goal.West Brom then missed a glorious chance from a well-worked free-kick that saw Phillips volley a cross towards Nacer Chadli at the far post.The Belgian was distracted by the slightest of touches by Emre Can, but Chadli should still have gobbled up the chance.Instead he missed his kick and Liverpool almost broke away and scored.Firmino crossed for Coutinho, who sent a difficult shot wide at the far-post. Coutinho then tried another long-range shot but it never troubled Foster.And Liverpool s defensive vulnerability was exposed again when Robson-Kanu raced onto a simple ball over the top but he snatched at his shot and Simon Mignolet made a comfortable save.
