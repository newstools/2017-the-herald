LONDON. &#8211; Arsene Wenger says Arsenal must win every one of their remaining English Premier League soccer matches if they are to stand any chance of finishing in the top four. The Gunners cut the gap to fourth-placed Manchester City to seven points with a 2-1 victory at Middlesbrough on Monday night and have a game in hand on Pep Guardiola s side.Goals from Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil either side of an Alvaro Negredo strike for the hosts sealed the points for Arsenal but Wenger knows there is no margin for error if they are to secure Champions League football again next season.Wenger said: For us, the clarity is there &#8211; we have to win every game to have a chance to get in the top four, starting tonight. I think it will make the team a bit more serene. You could see that on some occasions, we were a bit over-cautious tonight. Hopefully that will give us a bit more confidence. Mathematically it is still possible, even if it is difficult, but we have to give it a go. Wenger said Arsenal s win over Middlesbrough will help to repair the damaged confidence following their bad run. - Sky Sports.
