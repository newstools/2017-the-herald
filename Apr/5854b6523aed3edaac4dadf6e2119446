Joseph KabilaKinshasa. &#8211; Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila pledged on Wednesday the appointment of a new prime minister this week in line with a stalled December peace deal struck with the opposition. The prime minister will absolutely have to be named within 48 hours, Kabila said in a much-awaited speech to MPs and senators on the power-sharing agreement struck to avoid a full-blown crisis following his failure to step down at the end of his second and final mandate.
