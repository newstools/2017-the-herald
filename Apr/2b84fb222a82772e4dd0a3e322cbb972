Taurai MangwiroPaul Mundandi in ZVISHAVANE TRIANGLE coach Taurai Mangwiro has urged fans in the Lowveld not to panic ahead of the teams Castle Lager Premiership match against Chicken Inn at Gibbo tomorrow. Mangwiro drew his first match away with Chapungu and fought a 2-2 draw at home against former champions Dynamos before his team lost to newboys Bantu Rovers at Luveve last weekend. We are not under pressure. We are very aware of the importance of a victory at home in front of our own fans. We want to feel accepted and we need to make sure we win on Sunday. In Bulawayo we did not play badly, but it was just unfortunate that we missed chances and if you miss chances in football you get punished, said Mangwiro.Veteran midfielder Stephen Alimenda has also backed Mangwiro. I moved to Triangle because Mangwiro is a great coach. I am enjoying my stay here and our presence here is to prove wrong those who thought that we are over the hill. My burning desire is to win the championship with Triangle. It s still early day yet and those who are ruling us out can do that at their own peril. We are a strong team and we believe that we will have people in the Lowveld and Masvingo province smiling each time we play, said the former Dynamos captain.
