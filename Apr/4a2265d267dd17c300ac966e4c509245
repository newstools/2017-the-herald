Mahmoud AhmadinejadTEHRAN. &#8211; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran s former two-time president, has registered to contest the 12th round of presidential elections in the country. Ahmadinejad, who filled the role of the country s chief executive for two consecutive mandates starting in 2005, signed up for the competition at the Election Office, which is based within the Interior Ministry s premises in the capital Tehran on yesterday.He has already thrown his weight behind Hamid Baghaei, a former aide. Ahmadinejad was accompanying Baghaei, who also went through the registration process. Accompanying the two was Esfandiar Rahim-Mashaei, another former Ahmadinejad aide.The three were seen holding up their chained hands, shouting, Viva spring, Viva Iran. Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has advised Ahmadinejad not to run for president in the May elections, saying his potential candidacy would polarise the general atmosphere governing the country.Ahmadinejad had also said he would submit to the advice and had no plans to partake in the polls. The registration process began on Tuesday. Under Iran s constitution, presidents are allowed to serve two consecutive four-year terms. This is expected to make incumbent Hassan Rouhani a potential candidate.Rouhani, however, has so far refused to announce his candidature, nor has he associated himself with either of the main electoral currents, the Principlist and Reformist camps. Also contesting the polls is Ebrahim Raeesi, the chief custodian of Astan Quds Razavi, the organisation managing the affairs of the holy shrine of Imam Reza, the eighth Shia Imam, in the city of Mashhad.The registration process is to last for three more days and Iranians will go to the polls on May 19. &#8211; Press TV.
