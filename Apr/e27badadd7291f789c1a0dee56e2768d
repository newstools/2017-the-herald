What we have described as being master of our destiny&#8230;.if a foreign country decides to be hostile we must defend ourselves.&#8220;No other nation can disturb that continuity in our sense eternal life of our people but in the biblical sense it&#8217;s not the eternity that pastors speak of. We need that independence and freedom, that right when everyone of us can beat his chest and say I belong to a country, I am a Zimbabwean, I am a child of the soil.&#8221;1327: &#8220;Young as he still was, born in 1959, kungonzwa kuti mumwe wedu aenda you ask questions why why why why? We asked the same question two weeks ago why why why why? Noone can answer the why, we try to go to the pastors, the men of God and ask them to give the explanation why why why? Why should we depart from this earth?&#8220;They don&#8217;t have the answer either, they&#8217;ll refer you to the holy book, the bible and the answer comes perhaps when they lay you to rest vachiti chakabva muvhu chinodzokera muvhu, woti ko ndakabva muvhu hongu ko handingoramba ndiri mupenyu here sevhu iroro?

Musafambe nepapapa pane nyoka munga rumwe.&#8221;1311: &#8220;We are back home, thank God he&#8217;s one of those who returned alive. He had worked hard, sacrificed so much for the freedom and independence of Zimbabwe. That independence had come in 1980, he didn&#8217;t go back to education to continue where he had left, no, he had acquired a new experience which now made him a suitable person for a role in intelligence and security and this is what he had studied in Bulgaria alongside 14 others. It was time for him to practice what he had learnt and improve on it,&#8221;1303: &#8220;He, like his colleagues, was determined to fight for a liberated Zimbabwe alongside others, sacrificed in the same spirit as others. Well, what did it mean? I mentioned that he had to sacrifice like others, it meant that the hardships of the struggle whatever they may be, hunger, the consequence of illness, attack from the enemy. If these ills find you they find you, you will be ready.&#8220;&#8216;Let them come, I&#8217;m prepared to die for my country. So the leaders take heed, whatever training you can give me like the training you have given others I&#8217;ll accept, whatever command you give I&#8217;ll obey&#8217;, that was the spirit, the spirit of Zenzo as indeed it was the spirit of others and thus you dedicate yourself in that manner and give yourself up, reject the pleasures that were yours or would have been yours back home.&#8221;1257: Self sacrifice was one of Ntuliki&#8217;s strongest attributes, self sacrifice, the struggle demanded&#8230;..sacrifice did not mean just going out and joining the other comrade. It meant that at heart, in your own mind as a comrade you were truly decided come what may to fight for the country. He vividly demonstrated this by his preparedness to forgo his secondary education, midway we are told as he joined the liberation struggle alongside other youths.&#8221;1254: &#8220;We have worked with&#8230;we will also try to give our own narrative, our won description of Zenzo&#8217;s life as we saw it, as we had it and of course that fact that he&#8221;s being laid here is a demonstration that he was a comrade, a comrade at arms a comrade&#8230;who has sacrificed to go through that grief, that suffering alongside the rest of us,&#8221;Zimbabwe Defence Forces Commander General Constantino Chiwenga (left) with Central Intelligence Organisation director-general Retired Major-General Happyton Bonyongwe at Stodart hall.1251: &#8220;Comrades and friends only two weeks ago we were here to be bury a freedom fighter of the second chimurenga James Murozvi, today again with tears still on our cheeks we have been called by circumstances to come to this shrine as we mourn the departure of a gallant son of our second liberation struggle Cde Zenzo Ntuliki.&#8220;May I on behalf of Zanu-PF and Government and on behalf of my family wish and extend my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the bereaved members of the Ntuliki family who have lost their strong pillar of strength.
