SOCHI. Formula One champions Mercedes have led every lap of every Russian Grand Prix since the race made its debut around Sochi s Olympic Park in 2014, but Ferrari s Sebastian Vettel will aim to break that streak this weekend. The four times world champion is enjoying his best start to a season since he was at Red Bull in 2011, leading Lewis Hamilton by seven points after two wins and a second place from the first three races.Another win, at the street circuit where the German finished second in 2015, would signal Ferrari s best opening four races since 2008. Things start to click and hopefully that sort of success now in the first couple of races helps us to build up some sort of momentum that maybe these guys (Mercedes) had in the past, said Vettel after winning in Bahrain on April 16.Hamilton, presented with the winner s trophy by Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2014 and 2015 before now-retired Mercedes team mate and champion Nico Rosberg won from pole position last year, felt the pain in Bahrain. We re going to push hard together, re-gather as a team and come back fighting, he said after collecting a time penalty and finishing second.Mercedes, who still look faster over a single lap in qualifying, have done plenty of homework since then but recognise they have a battle on their hands. In this season with these new regulations, you can t take anything for granted, said team boss Toto Wolff. Reuters.
