Fungai Lupande Court Reporter Borrowdale Primary School lost almost $16 000 to two NMB bank officials who made internal transfers without the school s knowledge in a hard cash gamble. The bank officials &#8211; Ellen Chigodora (34), a customer service officer; and operations manager Tsungai Beta (37) &#8211; are being jointly charged for fraud with Terrence Magoronga (22), a salesperson for Property Enterprises.The trio appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Barbara Chimboza last week and were remanded to May 19 on $200 bail each.Prosecutor Ms Audrey Chogumaira alleged that sometime in February this year, Magoronga was approached by Itai Muteve, who was looking for cash.Muteve, who is reportedly on the run, operates a beverage wholesale at High Glen Shopping Mall in Harare.It is alleged that Stephen Mutumhe offered to provide cash upon transfer of money into his bank account.The court heard that on March 17, Tandiwe Fungurani submitted to the bank two internal transfer instructions with forged signatures of Borrowdale Primary School officials of $8 340 and $7 624.Chigodora accepted the instructions and processed them without verifying whether or not Fungurani was authorised to transact on behalf of the school.She took the transaction to Beta for authorisation.It is alleged that Beta authorised the transaction without verifying with the school and the money was allegedly transferred into Mutumhe s personal bank account.The court heard that Magoronga approached Mutumhe in the company of two unknown females claiming to be officials from Borrowdale Primary School.They claimed the money and Mutumhe allegedly handed the cash over and, four days later, the school received an e-mail of the transfer from NMB.The school headmaster went to the bank and was shown two copies of the internal transfers. The school lost $15 964 and nothing was recovered.
