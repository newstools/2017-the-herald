Fungai Lupande Court Reporter A Mvurwi-based medical doctor is on the run after allegedly certifying the death of five people, who are actually alive, in a life insurance scam.The doctor was not named in court papers yesterday, but his accomplices &#8211; Paul Jayaguru (35), his wife Dorothy Dulula (35) and a mortuary attendant at Mvurwi Hospital Chrispen Mumba (40) &#8211; were remanded to May 19 on $200 bail each. Harare magistrate Ms Barbara Chimboza ordered the trio to report every Friday at Mvurwi CID, to reside at their respective addresses and not to interfere with State witnesses.The complainant is Heritage Life Limited represented by its loss control officer Mr Charles Chirove.Prosecuting, Ms Audrey Chogumaira alleged that sometime in November 2012, the doctor and his accomplices connived to open two funeral policies for Raymond Jayaguru and his wife s brother.It is alleged that the beneficiary for Jayaguru s policy was listed as his daughter, Ruramai Jayaguru.The court heard that the policy matured in three months and in the event of death, the beneficiary was required to submit a burial order or death certificate.It is alleged that on April 12, 2013 Dulula made a death claim of $3 000 for Jayaguru after misrepresented that he had died the previous day.Mumba created a BD 11 Form indicating that Jayaguru s body was at Mvurwi Hospital, the court heard.It is alleged that Mumba took the form to the doctor who certified the death without seeing the deceased body.Dulula took the fake papers to the Registrar-General s Office in Concession and obtained a burial order number MAZ/296/13.The death claim was processed and on May 14, 2015 Heritage Life Limited transferred $3 000 into Dulula s bank account.It is alleged that sometime in May 2014, Jayaguru opened a second funeral policy with Simbarashe Dulula and others as beneficiaries.A year later, Simbarashe was reported dead on May 7, 2015 and Mumba created another BD 11 Form and took it to the doctor to certify.A burial order was obtained and a death claim of $5 000 was processed on May 11, 2015.The court heard that a funeral policy for Tinevimbo Jayaguru was opened and she died on June 22, 2015.A claim of $1 461 was processed two days later.The quartet also managed to defraud the life assurance company with a policy for Sean Jayaguru.They almost got away with $4 761 on February 16 this year.The offence came to light after Mr Chirove approached the Registrar-General s Office in Concession to verify the burial orders.Investigations revealed that all the five people alleged to be dead were alive and living in Gweru.Heritage Life Limited lost $11 961.
