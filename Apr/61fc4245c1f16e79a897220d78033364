While in Hampako s room, the pair searched his bags and reportedly took $700, 400 Zambian kwacha and $300 in bond notes.It is alleged that the two cops recorded only $700 in their notebooks and ordered Hampako to declare any other cash he had.Hampako told them that he had $30 000 in his car and the pair forced him to check out of the hotel and drove to their offices.It is further alleged that Hanya and Ziuchi took the $30 000 and threatened Hampako with a lengthy prison term if he remained in the country. He was allegedly given back 400 kwacha.They told him he would be charged with money laundering, before asking him to sign a fake warned and cautioned statement purporting he was being charged of fraud.They released him the following morning around 6am and gave him back his 400 Kwacha and remained with all the cash, the State alleged.The police officers ordered Hampako to return to his country.In a bid to conceal the crime, the officers, it is alleged, did not record Hampako s arrest in their occurrence book.Hampako is said to have lodged a complaint against the pair at Police General Headquarters.Upon getting wind that a report had been made, Hanya and Ziuchi opened an enquiry reference.Hanya then took up the case without involving the Officer-in-Charge as is the procedure, the court heard.
