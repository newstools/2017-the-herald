My joy comes from teaching the instrument and spreading it to the world than recording. I would love to see the disabled becoming maestros in the mbira genre and to even surpass the likes of the late mbira greats like Chiwoniso Maraire and Ephat Mujuru, he said.He highlighted that the Jairos Jiri Mbira Ensemble is ready to share the same stage with the likes of Mbira DzeNharira and nyunga nyunga mbira players like Jah Prayzah. My dream is to see mbira being appreciated by different classes of society, he said.The band is versatile in almost all genres, for example, they play gospel music and Zimdancehall using the mbira instrument.The return of the band is likely to remind people of the good old days when Jairos Jiri Band made a mark under the leadership of the late Paul Matavire who made a mark with his outstanding talent before moving on to form his own ensemble, Hit Machine.Jairos Jiri Band proved to be one of the best outfits and Chikumbirike hopes to take the new ensemble to another level.
