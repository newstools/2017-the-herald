PARIS. &#8211; Little over a month after producing the greatest comeback in Champions League soccer history, Barcelona need another special turnaround as they face Juventus in the second leg of their quarter-final tomorrow night. Luis Enrique s side were taken apart in the first leg in Turin, losing 3-0 to a Juve team inspired by Paulo Dybala, who scored twice.In the last 16 they became the first team ever to overturn a 4-0 deficit when they beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-1 in the return at the Camp Nou, so fans are hoping for a similar remuntada this time. We are going to take as many risks as we need to the point that we could go out with eight strikers, as we have nothing to lose, said Luis Enrique after Saturday s 3-2 defeat of Real Sociedad.The Barcelona coach also called for supporters to have faith in these players who have won everything. This is a squad of champions. But he added: The thing is that we are used to always eating beluga caviar. That can t go on forever. Barca welcome back midfielder Sergio Busquets from suspension, while Juve are hopeful Dybala will be ready after he came off in the 2-0 weekend win at Pescara with a sprained ankle. We have four days and we need to be optimistic, declared coach Massimiliano Allegri. &#8211; AFP.
