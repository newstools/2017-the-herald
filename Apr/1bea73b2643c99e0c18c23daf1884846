Rev ChivaviroArts Correspondent Spillway Restaurant at Lake Chivero will this Easter holiday be a place of blessings as it hosts a family gospel show tomorrow. The show will feature musicians Rev TT Chivaviro, Bethen Pasinawako, Tatenda Mahachi and Pastor Olinda Marowa.The lakeside resort is known for its ambiance that has been enhanced by water that is plunging from Lake Chivero a few metres from the restaurant.To the other side of the restaurant is a dense forest adorned by natural beauty and the sound of the plunging water echoes in a nearby mountain, making the place ideal for refreshing family outing.The unique sounds and sights will likely blend well with gospel vibes as people and nature worship the creator in unison.Dzikama Rufu of Spillway Restaurant said they had set aside a day of gospel music during Easter holiday to give Christian families a platform to worship and also have fun away from the church in a social and refreshing environment. This is Easter time and most people will be going to church, but our programme will serve those that will not be at conferences. Even those at conferences in areas around Harare and Norton can just drive for a refreshing music break and braai, said Rufu. I know church programmes are more serious and we are saying ours is an event for these Christians to relax, dance to music, have fun and eat together as families. The line-up of musicians is good and many will be looking forward to Rev Chivaviro s Ebenezer hit. All the performers complement each other well because they have worked together before.Meanwhile Pastor Olinda who is co-founder of Grace Life Covenant will also retrace her steps when she graces sermons in Gweru.The Ndinouya hit-maker together with her husband-cum-manager Michael Ziwenga said though they have relocated to Harare they would sometime retrace their footsteps.Their church was formed in Gweru and there was need for them to visit their roots regularly. We are revisiting our roots this Easter and we are looking forward to it, said Ziwenga.They will be having other guest speakers at the event that will run for the weekend.Comedian-cum-musician Mai Titi will be the host at the conference.
