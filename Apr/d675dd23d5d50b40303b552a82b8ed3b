Tanaka Vunganai Herald Reporter Government is upbeat about Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Dr Walter Mzembi s chances of landing the United Nations World Tourism Organisation secretary-general post following a 15-day campaign in four Sadc countries. Elections for the post are slated for May 11 and 12 at the organisation s headquarters in Madrid, Spain, during the 105th meeting of the 33-member executive council.Deputy Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry Anastancia Ndlovu visited Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Mozambique from April 1 to drum up support for Minister Mzembi.The post of UNWTO secretary-general falls vacant in December.Dr Mzembi is the African Union and Sadc candidate for the post, which has never been occupied by an African. There is a high chance that Zimbabwe will win since most African countries are supporting us, Deputy Minister Ndlovu said.DRC pledged to support Zimbabwe s candidate when that country s Tourism Minister Andre Moke Sanza met Deputy Minister Ndlovu.He was quoted as saying: Zimbabwe s win of this global tourism post is good for the region, continent and world over. This will also help in the Reform Agenda of the UN by the AU. Deployment of Dr Mzembi, an African, to such a high-level agency of the UN system entails a very high level of diplomatic placement by the continental body, AU. This shall help the continent achieve some of her goals as explicitly espoused in the Agenda 2063, as tourism is a very strong soft power for international diplomacy. Mozambican Minister of Tourism Mr Silva Armando Thenduro told Deputy Minister Ndlovu that some candidates had tried to persuade his country to vote for them.
