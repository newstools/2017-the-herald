President Rouhani put forth the idea on Saturday. He has also condemned the use of chemical weapons by any party.Iran s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has been holding telephone conversations with world leaders to stress the need for a fact-finding probe.The Iranian foreign minister has also talked to European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, as well as his Russian, Omani, Syrian, and Algerian counterparts over the matter.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said yesterday that foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Syria would hold a meeting in Moscow this week to discuss the US strikes against Syria.
