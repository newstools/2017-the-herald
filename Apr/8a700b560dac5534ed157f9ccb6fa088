Arsene WengerLONDON. Arsene Wenger has insisted his Arsenal players have the character to halt a run of four successive away defeats when they visit Middlesbrough tonight as they look to revive their bid to finish in the English Premier League s top four. Wenger s team are now 10 points off a place among the leading quartet after Liverpool edged strugglers Middlesbrough 1-0 yesterday.But Arsenal know they need a dramatic improvement if they are to qualify for the Champions League for a 21st successive season.The dismal 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace last time out highlighted how far the team has fallen since the period before Christmas when they were viewed as genuine challengers for the Premier League title.Theo Walcott s admission after that loss at Selhurst Park that Palace wanted it more reflected badly on a group of players who have lost their way and strengthened the belief of all those who believe veteran French manager Wenger should leave Arsenal when his contract expires art the end of the season.Jack Wilshere, the Arsenal midfielder currently on a season-long loan to Bournemouth, offered his view that the players must take their share of responsibility for the club s current problems. Sometimes a manager can only do so much, as in prepare a team and then the team have to go out there and perform, Wilshere told Sky Sports.But despite the recent setbacks, Wenger has backed his players to turn the situation around.
