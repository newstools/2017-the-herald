LONDON. &#8211; With Chelsea out of sight at the top of the English Premier League soccer table and Tottenham showing a very unSpursy consistency, the title race that looked over is rumbling on. But beneath those two London clubs a closer, and more exciting contest is emerging, with four teams battling for the two remaining Champions League spots. Manchester City picked up just a point in their two games this week against rivals Arsenal and Chelsea, Liverpool threw away a lead against lowly Bournemouth, while Arsenal bounced back from a poor run of form to close the gap again.Unless Leicester repeat their miracle-working of last season and go on to win the Champions League, two of those four will make it into Europe s premier competition next season, while two will miss out.So who will it be? Sportsmail looks at the strengths and weaknesses of the contenders, the difficulty of their run-in, and their chances of making the top four&#8230;LIVERPOOL &#8211; 31 games, 60 pointsWhat a weird week Jurgen Klopp is having. First there was the convincing win in the Merseyside derby, a huge boost as all three of Liverpool s rivals dropped points.But they lost Sadio Mane to injury, and this season his absence has meant a huge drop-off in results and performances.That continued on Wednesday when they fell behind to Bournemouth, came back to lead, only to concede late on.They are still in pole position, although Arsenal, City and United could all pass them with their games in hand.Mane could be out for the rest of the season, and their tendency to drop points against weaker teams, while beating the top six, means an easy-looking run-in might not be all that simple.Positive signs: Points on the board, and an attack that has scored the most goals in the league, plus no cup competitions to distract themNegative signs: Shocking without Mane &#8211; they have not won a league game he has missed &#8211; and comparatively weak against the lesser teams, this will be a test of their resilience if those around them start winning.Top four rating: 3/5Liverpool s next fixtures: April 8 v Stoke (A); April 16 v West Brom (A); April 23 v Crystal Palace (H); May 1 v Watford (A); May 7 v Southampton (H); May 13 v West Ham (A); May 21 v Middlesbrough (H).MANCHESTER CITY &#8211; 30 games, 58 pointsTwo good performances, but four goals conceded and only one point earned this week &#8211; the trips to London have not been kind to Pep Guardiola s side over the past four days.If they win their game in hand they ll go above Liverpool and into third, and the quality in their side should mean a top four place is easy enough to wrap up.Aside from a home Manchester derby and given their dominance in that fixture at Old Trafford you d have to back them heavily, they have a pretty easy run-in, with five of their remaining eight games at home.Defensive flaws remain, but against the limited opposition they are due to face, they might even be thinking about Spurs in second place.Positive signs: It s in their hands, they have a simple run-in, and despite poor results they aren t playing badly.Negative signs: The defence is still a huge worry, and this City squad don t always react brilliantly once the possibility of the title has faded away. With an FA Cup semi-final ahead, will they have the motivation to keep pushing?Top four rating: 4/5Manchester City s next fixtures: April 8 v Hull (H); April 14 v Southampon (A); April 27 v Manchester United (H); April 30 v Middlesbrough (A); May 6 v Crystal Palace (H); May 13 v Leicester (H); May 21 v Watford (A); TBC v West Brom (H).ARSENAL &#8211; 29 games, 54 pointsHere we go again. After the title race is over, written off in the race for the top four, Arsenal need to respond with a late-season burst to get Champions League football. But who would bet against them?The win against West Ham &#8211; and some of the attacking play against Man City &#8211; showed that the old swagger may be returning, although huge question marks remain.Two games in hand on Liverpool, and one on City, mean that they could get a top four spot even if the Anfield club win every game. But Arsenal have lacked consistency this year, and the unrest around the club still seems like it could hamper them.As for catching Tottenham &#8211; it s possible, but 11 points with a game in hand is an awful lot, even compared to recent years. Fail to beat Spurs at White Hart Lane and St Totteringham s Day is in serious danger of not happening for the first time since 1995.Positive signs: Four points from their last two games, two games in hand, and suddenly a bit of positivity is emerging around the club. A good run-in and this could still be deemed a successful season.Negative signs: Two hugely tough games against Spurs and Man United could hold the key, and Arsenal have been poor in big games recently. The fixture pile-up, with an FA Cup semi-final to come as well, means games in hand are by no means guaranteed points.Top four rating: 2.5/5Arsenal s next fixtures: April 10 v Crystal Palace (A); April 17 v Middlesbrough (A); April 26 v Leicester (H); April 30 v Tottenham (A); May 7 v Manchester United (H); May 13 v Stoke (A); May 21 v Everton (H); TBC v Sunderland (H); TBC v Southampton (A).MANCHESTER UNITED &#8211; 29 games, 54 pointsThe most expensive side ever assembled in English Premier League history are back in sixth place again.Jose Mourinho has pointed the finger at referees, Luke Shaw, and even the woodwork, but the fact is his side have drawn their way back out of the Champions League race.They can still go level with Liverpool if they win their two games in hand, but with Europa League games to come potentially five more fixtures before the end of the season and injuries mounting, the odds are against them.Four of their nine remaining league games are also against teams above them, twice as many as any of their rivals.That said, it s not far from clicking, and a run of wins would put things back in their hands, particularly if they beat City and Arsenal in the type of games Mourinho relishes. They re outsiders, but don t write them off yet!And even if it all goes wrong, they must be favourites for the Europa League, which would mean Champions League qualification wherever they finish in the league.Positive signs: It s in their hands, and surely they ll stop drawing games some time.Negative signs: They don t score enough, they draw too often, they have the toughest run-in, a fixture pile-up and an injury crisis.Top four rating: 2/5Manchester United s next fixtures: April 9 v Sunderland (A); April 16 v Chelsea (H); April 23 v Burnley (A); April 27 v Manchester City (A); April 30 v Swansea (H); May 7 v Arsenal (A); May 13 v Tottenham (A); May 21 v Crystal Palace (H); TBC v Southampton (A).And what about Everton?Well, before the Merseyside derby they looked in a decent position, level on points with Arsenal, but one point from two games have seen them fall off the pace.Having played two games more than Man United or Arsenal it would be a huge ask for Ronald Koeman s side to close the gap.
