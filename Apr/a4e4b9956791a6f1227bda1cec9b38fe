MONACO. A brilliant Monaco side that has taken Europe by storm will not relent in their bid for glory after beating Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League soccer semi-finals, promised coach Leonardo Jardim. The team from the Mediterranean principality were too good for their German opponents in Wednesday night s quarter-final second leg, winning 3-1 at the Stade Louis II to advance 6-3 on aggregate. We have won nothing, but we have made history, declared Portuguese coach Jardim after the game, as his side extended a run that began in the third qualifying round against Fenerbahce last July, nine months ago.
