The onus remains with the Zimbabwean masses to tell the wood from the trees, to safeguard their hard-won independence and sovereigntyStephen Mpofu Correspondent The political scenario in Zimbabwe is fast becoming curioser and curioser ahead of next year s harmonised elections. To begin with, Zimbabweans are touted and in that respect hug themselves as the most literate nation on the African continent with an over 90 percent literacy rating.Tragically, however, while basking in the glowing profile of being well read, some of the Zimbabweans who brag of being people s leaders turn out through their actions as being functionally illiterate, politically.For how on earth do literate and therefore wise people embrace an enemy whose track record against the black people of this country has remained evil for as far back as human memory can recall?It is in this regard, therefore, that a big question mark hangs over opposition political coalitions abetted and financed to a large extent by imperialist forces that for decades rode on the backs of blacks in the motherland as though these were natural mounts?The same forces stripped our people of their rights in the heyday of colonialism, turning them into virtual serfs.But not only that. The same colonialists stripped our country s natural resources the same way they looted the riches of other African colonies, carting off the spoils to build palaces back home in their native countries.Given that white-master versus african-slave scenario, do Zimbabwean opposition parties that court sworn enemies of this country or are courted by them to do the donkey work of regime change, not realise that they are being made to fight a proxy war for the foreign enemy against both their own people and themselves?In fact, are they so preoccupied with a desire to get into power themselves that these Zimbabweans do not realise that should they actually effect regime change they will push the enemy s hegemonic agenda, and not their own agenda for the good of this nation as a whole?For that reason, it is this pen s honest belief that any political coalition financed or aided otherwise by imperialist forces is devoid of any hint of patriotism about it.In the history of this country, the only patriotic political coalition which was in all intents and purposes genuine was the one between PF-Zapu and Zanu-PF, a front which resulted in the removal of the white racist minority regime of Ian Smith in 1980.The run-up to the 2018 elections has exposed increasingly nefarious Machiavellian activities by Harare-based European Union hyenas in sheepskin in the affairs of our country, with in some cases lots of money being dangled in the eyes of local non-governmental organisations and political coalitions if these closed their ranks and fought a proxy war for imperialists to remove the ZANU-PF Government from power.But it should be realised that any financial support promised or given is not charity as such.On the contrary, financial aid is a strategic lever to swing things in the donors favour and not merely to put proxies in power, as those being hoodwinked into forming coalitions against Zanu-PF might in their shallow minds actually believe.Ultimately, therefore, the onus remains with the Zimbabwean masses to tell the wood from the trees, to safeguard their hard-won independence and sovereignty.In this respect, functional political literacy as an empowerment tool among the masses will strip the foreign hyenas of their sheep s skin camouflage to send the enemy scurrying off the political arena in our country, with patriotism reasserting itself in the void created by the demise of proxysm.Moreover, those political entities allowing themselves to be used as proxies of the enemies of Zimbabwe have not demonstrated any leadership acumen themselves, so that only crocodile tears may be shed over their exit, or neutralisation in the political scene.It is time that the political revolution that wrested the motherland from an otherwise intractable grip by an oppressive, racist foreign ruing culture took precedence over an individual political aggrandisement for our nation state to remain focused and invincible against contemporary imperialism.In the final analysis, therefore, only the masses in this country have the wherewithal to ensure that the revolution does continue unimpeded on its original course to give all of us and future generations a happy destiny.Aluta continua!
