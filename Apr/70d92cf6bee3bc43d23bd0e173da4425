Fidelis Munyoro Chief Court Reporter The National Prosecution Authority is facing manpower crisis following the resignation of 24 law officers over the past two years without replacement, a development likely to paralyse operations of the authority. Acting Prosecutor-General Advocate Ray Goba said as it stood, two law officers were serving notice while four others were discharged from the service, bringing the total number to 30 and all without replacement.Adv Goba made the revelation while addressing a gathering at the launch of the National Prosecuting Authority s (NPA) Four-year Strategic Planning in Harare yesterday.Adv Goba blamed the massive resignations on poor working conditions.He urged Government to urgently intervene and curb the flight of professional staff. We are informed by the Treasury that the situation is likely to remain the same until a new structure is approved, said Adv Goba. I would like to implore Government to address the situation urgently to prevent a complete breakdown in staff morale and paralysis of operations as this will have the unintended consequence of facilitating criminal activity with impunity. The NPA became operational in 2015 following the enactment of the NPA Act.It has 261 permanent staff, 213 are seconded staff of a total current complement of 461 personnel across the country.Of the total, 378 are in prosecution while 96 are in administrative posts.The seconded members are drawn from other Government ministries, offices and agencies including the Zimbabwe Republic Police, Prisons and Correctional Services and Defence.Adv Goba said he was grateful for the assistance offered as without that help, operations of the NPA would at this juncture be severely curtailed.He assured the public that the seconded staff members were Zimbabwean patriots carefully chosen to provide skills in areas the NPA was deficient. This is a temporary arrangement and they have been providing tremendously valuable service, he said adding, These seconded officers happen in fact to be among the most disciplined employees in the organisation. Adv Goba, however, said the NPA has developed an establishment structure that is under consideration by the Civil Service Commission and Treasury.He said once the structure is approved, their immediate task would be to align the structure to the strategic plan and to cascade the strategy down to every level of the organisation.
