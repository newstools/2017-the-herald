PARIS. &#8211; Novak Djokovic spearheads Serbia s bid to reach the Davis Cup tennis semi-finals for the first time since 2013 and reboot a career which has stalled since his history-making French Open victory. Although Djokovic is still number two in the world, the 29-year-old remains a shadow of the man whose maiden Roland Garros title in June last year allowed him to boast ownership of all four majors.Shock early losses at Wimbledon, the Rio Olympics and Australian Open have been compounded by a recent elbow injury which sidelined him from the Miami Masters.Since the start of 2017 Djokovic has won just seven matches but he insists that this weekend s Davis Cup clash at home to Spain provides the perfect platform for the defence of his French Open title, the only Grand Slam still in his possession. I always draw very positive energy from these weeks, said Djokovic, who won the Davis Cup in 2010, as he sat alongside teammates in Belgrade where the quarter-final takes place. I have shared some amazing moments in my career, in my life, with the people that are sitting at this table. Playing for our country in the official team competition &#8211; the only official team competition we have in (this) sport &#8211; is definitely very special, added Djokovic, who is on an 11-match win streak in Davis Cup singles. Five-time champions Spain won the only previous meeting between the two countries 4-1 in 2009, with Rafael Nadal defeating Djokovic in the decisive rubber. &#8211; AFP.
