LONDON. &#8211; There was a time when late-season North London derbies involved Tottenham trying to stop Arsenal from winning the English Premier League soccer title. Thirteen years ago this week, the Gunners Invincibles secured the crown at White Hart Lane, while Spurs finished 14th.But the dynamic has gradually changed. When the pair met at the Lane last March, both teams were aiming for top spot. Now Spurs are the ones representing North London in the title race while Arsenal have ground to make up in the top-four fight. Tomorrow could be pivotal to both sides chances.Chelsea will play their toughest remaining league fixture at Everton, while the two Manchester clubs &#8211; who lie above Arsene Wenger s side &#8211; are also in action. Whatever happens, the pressure will be on both Spurs and Arsenal to respond when they kick off.Tottenham will not need any extra motivation, but there is plenty of it nonetheless. They are poised to finally finish above their North London rivals for the first time in 22 years, and a victory in tomorrow s head-to-head would officially finish the job.It would be the perfect way for Spurs fans to celebrate the occasion, with their sworn enemies in front of them on the pitch and in the away end &#8211; and it would be doubly sweet because this is due to be the last-ever North London derby at White Hart Lane.So far, Tottenham have beaten every local rival they have faced in N17 this season, triumphing over Crystal Palace, West Ham, Chelsea, Millwall and Watford. Victory over Arsenal would complete that set. &#8211; ESPN.
