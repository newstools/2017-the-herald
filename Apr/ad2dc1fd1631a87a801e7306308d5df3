LONDON. It is a motley crew of Manchester United players heading to Brussels as history beckons for the 20-time champions of England. With the likes of Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Chris Smalling and even David De Gea injured and likely to miss tonight s clash with Anderlecht, a gaggle of unlikely lads will look to propel the three-time European soccer champions to a first ever victory in the continent s secondary club competition.The much-maligned and oft-derided Marouane Fellaini captained United to a 3-0 win away to Sunderland on Sunday and unless Michael Carrick is restored to tonight s starting line-up, the Belgian could find himself wearing the armband again against the club where he began his youth career.
