LONDON. Mauricio Pochettino insists nothing is impossible as Tottenham Hotspur attempt to increase the pressure on English Premier League soccer leaders Chelsea. Second-placed Spurs travel to face Swansea City tonight, with their title hopes buoyed by Chelsea s shock loss to Crystal Palace last weekend.With north London club Spurs beating Burnley, it meant the Blues 10-point advantage at the top of the table was cut to seven points.And that gap could narrow even further tonight, when Chelsea are at home to Manchester City on the same night as Spurs manager Pochettino s side are in action in south Wales. That s a good lesson for all - belief is the most important thing in football - not only quality, running or being strong, said Pochettino. Belief, faith and fight. Nothing is impossible in football and that is our idea, our philosophy. The Argentinian added: We need to keep going in that direction and it s true the Premier League is tough to play in, and to win every game and compete. It s so competitive. But if it can happen? Yes, of course it can happen and our mind must be positive to try to imagine and dream and believe and give our best. AFP.
