They were supposed to come on Friday (tomorrow), but we had to move the date to tomorrow (today) after they requested to come early in order to have time to rehearse with Jah Prayzah, said Dee Nosh. I do not know what they are planning to do, but I believe they have something big they are planning for a joint act. After their arrival they will go straight to JP Studios to do the rehearsals. We are looking ahead to the show and we have put everything in place for the concert. There will be a number of other activities to entertain fans and we are glad to host these musicians on stage for the first time after their collaboration.
