BANGALORE. &#8211; A simmering feud between tennis stalwarts Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi has boiled over into an ugly public spat following India s latest Davis Cup triumph in Bangalore. No sooner had the hosts sealed a 4-1 win Sunday over Uzbekistan in the second round of the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group 1 tie, than Bhupathi lashed out at his former doubles partner, who was dropped from the squad last week. We gave him the option (of being a part of the squad and playing as a reserve) and he readily took it, Bhupathi, the non-playing Davis Cup captain, said after the win helped India qualify for the World Group playoff. So after that, to sulk about not being in the (playing) four was a bit unprofessional, Bhupathi said of his friend-turned-foe. Adding fuel to the fire, Bhupathi put up a screen shot of his WhatsApp conversation with Paes on social media in a free-for-all slugfest aimed at countering Paes charge of being dropped in humiliating fashion at the last minute. &#8211; AFP.
