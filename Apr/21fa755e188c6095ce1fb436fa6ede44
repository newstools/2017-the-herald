MADRID. They escaped with their Champions League soccer miracle still alive. Maybe it says everything about Leicester City s never-say-die spirit that they simply refused to buckle in the first leg of their quarter-final away to Atletico Madrid, and will go into next Tuesday s return leg believing they are still very much in the tie at 1-0 down.Bigger and more experienced European campaigners have crumbled in the Vicente Calderon Stadium, yet the Foxes grew as the game wore on and emerged with heads held high.And you would be foolish ever to write off Leicester after last season s title fairytale, even if overcoming Atletico would surely represent their biggest scalp to date.They have every right to feel aggrieved too, as Antoine Griezmann s decisive 28th minute penalty was given in error Marc Albrighton s challenge was clearly outside of the box.But rather than let their heads drop, the visitors showed real mental strength as they manned the trenches and defended as if their lives depended on it.Centre-half Robert Huth was a man mountain, his centre-back partner Yohan Benalouane defied expectations with some great blocks and midfielder anchorman Wilfried Ndidi was outstanding in the second half.Credit must also go to boss Craig Shakespeare who showed fantastic tactical nous at half-time in bringing on Andy King and shore up the midfield.
