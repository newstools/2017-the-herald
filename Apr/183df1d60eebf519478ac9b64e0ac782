Sikhumbuzo Moyo in BULAWAYO Highlanders . . . . . . . . . . . . . (0) 2 Bulawayo City . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 HIGHLANDERS reaped due rewards for an afternoon when they dominated their city neighbours to open their 2017 Castle Lager Premiership campaign with a victory before a good crowd at Barbourfields yesterday. Bosso capped a perfect day for themselves through two goals by Prince Dube, who is tipped to have a breakthrough season this year, and midfielder Simon Munawa.Newboy Rodreck Mutuma could have registered his name on the scorers sheet, but was denied by a poor offside call by Harare-based referee Nomore Musundire after hitting the back of the net from a Dube sitter in the 58th minute.Dube, who needs to change his attitude towards strike partner Mutuma, opened Bosso s account in the 56th minute after cleverly rounding drawn out City goalkeeper Aron Ngwenya to slot home from left-back Honest Moyo s through ball.Highlanders went 2-0 up in the 65th minute through a first-time hard and low shot by Munawa after being fed by Dube from the left flank. He is my man-of-the-match, legendary former Zimbabwe Saints, AmaZulu, Dynamos and Zimbabwe Warriors midfield maestro Ronald Gidiza Sibanda, who was a pundit for our sister radio station Star FM for yesterday s game, said as he lavished praise on Dube.Highlanders were clearly the better side with some nice passes from kick-off, although they seemed to fade away in the final third where City s Zibusiso Sibanda and Nyasha Mukumbi held fort in central defence only to crumble in the second half.Bosso were victims of an unfortunate call by referee Musundire in the 18th minute, ruling out a Dube goal on the basis that Munawa had been fouled by former Hwange left-back Munyaradzi Mungadze, having seemingly given advantage to the hosts.The Bulawayo giants were again asking questions in the 23rd minute, but this time Munawa s shot was deflected for a corner.Bosso were again the dominant force from the start of the second half and it was no surprise when they shot into the lead 11 minutes after resumption. We learnt the hard way, especially after losing concentration in the second half, but I am positive we will be able to pick ourselves up from this defeat. We held back for too long and it was only a matter of time before we collapsed, said City coach Mandla Lulu Mpofu after the match.Highlanders coach Erol Akbay said the first three points of the season were key. We played well in the first half. Although we did not score, we totally dominated them but I was not happy with our show in the last 20 minutes, said Akbay.The Dutchman also thanked the supporters for coming out in their numbers. They were with us all the way; such support can only encourage us. They are happy and we are happy with the win too, said Akbay.TeamsHighlanders: A. Sibanda, B. Ncube ,S. Munawa, P. Dube, B.
