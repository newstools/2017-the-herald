Last week the examiner went in depth in the discussion about the verification or confirmation of results. This week we would like to look at other services offered by the same department to the public.Certificate equivalence Certificate equivalence is service provided by Zimsec to educational institutions and individuals who have received regional or international certificates of education, and now wish to pursue their studies in Zimbabwe. Certified copies of the certificates must be submitted to Zimsec along with the relevant fees.Certificates are then assessed and qualifications weighed against the Zimsec qualifications to ascertain the level of competence achieved by the candidate; an example would be a holder of Ordinary level certificate from a country which is French or Portuguese speaking would need to get an equivalence certificate to be able to further their studies in Zimbabwe.This process take 7 working days from date of payment and submission of all necessary documents.Certifying statement of resultsFor lost certificates, Zimsec issues a certifying statement of results . Once a candidate has lost their certificates they can come to Zimsec offices and apply for the certifying statement of results.There is a form which they must fill and submit back to Zimsec along with the requisite fees, an additional search fee is charged if you do not know your candidate number.A certifying statement of results can be used exactly as the certificate would be used, it also has security features and marks which validate it as authentic.The process of getting this statement of results takes 28 days. Please note that Zimsec does not allow someone who is not the certificate holder to collect the certifying statement.It is important to note that when filling in the forms, a clear and true forwarding address should be put on the form.If the certificate holder is unable to come in and personally collect the certifying statement of results, it will be sent to the address supplied. An extra courier charge is applicable.It is very important for the applicant of any of the above to write their correct name as it appears on the certificates/birth certificates and provide accurate examination details.The examination centre, session and the year must be clearly and accurately filled in so as to avoid errors.NB: Zimsec DOES NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMBINE CERTIFICATES. Any attempt to do so is fraudulent and is punishable under the Zimsec Act and the laws of the Government of Zimbabwe.
