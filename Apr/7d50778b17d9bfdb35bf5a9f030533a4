Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter The Parliamentary Legal Committee has rejected amendments to the Land Commission Bill that were proposed and adopted by the Senate on Wednesday last week. The ruling was announced by the acting President of the Senate, Senator Charles Tawengwa on Thursday. I have received an adverse report on the Land Commission Bill (H. B, 2016), he said. What this means is that the chairperson of the Parliamentary Legal Committee, Honourable (Jonathan) Samukange, will come to this chamber, I believe Tuesday (tomorrow) afternoon, to present that report and indicate why there is that adverse report. The procedure then is that the Senators can debate and if they want can agree or disagree. Because the PLC is an advisory committee, it does not make a ruling, but the Senate will then make a ruling and say we reject what you are saying, we stand by the Bill or we agree with your adverse report. The Senate had adopted the Bill together with amendments that had been moved by Chief Mtshane with the concurrence of the Minister of Lands and Rural Resettlement, Dr Douglas Mombeshora.The Senate had amended Clause 3 of the Bill by making it a requirement that the President invites the National Council of Chiefs to submit names of two traditional leaders that qualified to be considered for appointment to the Commission.Clause 36 of the Bill was also amended so that traditional leaders would be represented by at least two chiefs in the panel appointed to deal with land disputes that fall under their jurisdiction.The Land Commission Bill seeks to operationalise functions of the Land Commission that was appointed by President Mugabe in June last year.It is chaired by Ms Tendai Bare and deputised by Tadious Muzoroza, while other members are Retired Major Abdul Nyathi, Jeanatte Manjengwa, Judith Buzuzi, Emmanuel Nyamusa, Margaret Chingamora, Edmore Mugwagwa Ndudzo and Luke Buka.The Commission is mandated to carry out periodic land audits and make recommendations to Government regarding acquisition of land for public purposes and equitable access to holding and occupation of agricultural land.
