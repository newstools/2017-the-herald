Sam DondoTawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent Upcoming musician Sam Dondo believes his second album Game Changer that will be launched at Meikles Hotel tomorrow will spur him to another level. The 10-track album was recorded at Vhiyali Studios owned by producer Munyaradzi Vhiya.He engaged the services of bassist Spencer Khumulani on some of the songs. I wanted to come up with something new on this album. We have done our homework in making sure fans will get what they want, Dondo said.The musician said he was happy with the response of the first album. Yes at first the response was not well, but later on people started to appreciate it, he said. When people criticise your work you listen and work on the short comings. I am hopeful that the album will change the game in the music industry, he said.Most of the songs are social-oriented, talking about what is going on in our contemporary society. As musicians we have time to get into the society and know what is going on. So when we compose songs we do justice to the society, he said.He thanked Impala Car Rentals for their support to his music. They have been very supportive to my music as well as trying to build my career. If we had several companies doing the same, our music would grow, he said.He will release two videos on the day of the launch. The videos are of high quality and this idea of videos gives people a way to understand the songs, he said.The musician s previous album Dyara Minamato had its mark on the local scene and it was preceded by great hype, but Dondo is still to claim a fair share of the music cake.He has done a number of shows and featured at some high profile gigs. The new album will determine his future in the industry.
