MONACO. &#8211; Novak Djokovic is looking to start afresh and win his second tennis title of the year in Monte-Carlo in what has been a mixed year for the Serb so far.After defeating Andy Murray in the final at Qatar, the former world number one suffered a second round exit at the 2017 Australian Open, losing to wild card Denis Istomin.Djokovic then suffered losses against Nick Kyrgios, in the Mexican Open and BNP Paribas Open, before having to withdraw from the Miami Open due to an elbow injury.The tennis ace is now back and has acknowledged that the season has not gone well for him so far, but is of the view that it is normal for even top players to go through blips. Obviously the first three months of the year didn t go the way I wanted, Djokovic said, as quoted on TennisWorldUSA. I didn t get results I was used to in the last seven or eight years, but I am aware that having ups and downs is normal enough for an athlete. I believe in myself, in my abilities and I think that results will come sooner or later. Now I am only focused on Monte Carlo and I hope it s the right place so that another tennis life for me starts. &#8211; AFP.
