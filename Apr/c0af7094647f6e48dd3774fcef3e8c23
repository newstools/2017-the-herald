Cde Sandi-MoyoNduduzo Tshuma and Nqobile Tshili THE Zanu-PF leadership in Bulawayo will decide whether to recommend the recall of Cde Eunice Nomthandazo Moyo from her position as provincial minister following her resignation from the Women s League on Thursday. In an interview yesterday, Cde Moyo said she would accept whatever decision the party took on her. Cdes Moyo and Sarah Mahoka resigned from their respective positions of deputy secretary and finance secretary in the Zanu-PF Women s League after a raft of allegations were levelled against them ranging from undermining the wing s secretary, First Lady Dr Grace Mugabe and fanning factionalism, with the latter facing a further charge of denigrating Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Presidential spokesperson, Mr George Charamba.The Zanu-PF Politburo on Wednesday accepted the resignations after Dr Mugabe presented a comprehensive report on their case.The party also directed that the two return the money they extorted from businesspeople, corporates and local prophets in the name of the First Lady and the Women s League.EARLIER RELATED POSTS Mash Central, Midlands say no to Kasukuwere Zimpapers is a security advantage Comrade Zanu-PF Women s League contraries, knowledge of history League resolves to fire Sandi Moyo, Mahoka The pair are alleged to have received $100 000 from a local prophet and $20 000 from the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development, and shared the loot among themselves.Zanu-PF Central Committee member Cde Judith Ncube said the party in Bulawayo would have to meet and discuss on whether to recommend that Cde Moyo be recalled as minister.
