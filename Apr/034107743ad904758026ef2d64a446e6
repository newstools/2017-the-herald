STUTTGART. &#8211; Maria Sharapova returns to tennis after a 15-month doping ban tomorrow, desperate to rediscover the glory which brought her five Grand Slams, the world s top ranking and a spectacular multi-million-dollar lifestyle. The poster girl of women s tennis won t necessarily be welcomed back with open arms by rivals who were already suspicious of the towering Russian s ice-cold detachment even before her fall from grace.However, Sharapova isn t losing any sleep as the 30-year-old prepares for her first match since being defeated by Serena Williams in the 2016 Australian Open quarter-finals That is the least of my concerns. I know that I am respected in my field. I see it in how my opponents play against me, said Sharapova who was controversially handed a wild card into this week s Stuttgart event, a clay court tournament sponsored by Porsche, one of her headline backers.She was even given a Wednesday start as that s the day her ban &#8211; imposed for testing positive for meldonium at last year s Australian Open &#8211; comes to an end. &#8211; AFP.
