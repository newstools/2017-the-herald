Alexis SanchezLONDON. &#8211; Alexis Sanchez is ready to give Arsenal one more year &#8211; as long as they prove their ambition in this summer s transfer market. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Sanchez wants to stay at Arsenal and that the delay on a new contract is down to the player s agent.Negotiations over a new deal have stalled, with Sanchez demanding a significant pay rise to remain at the Emirates.Sanchez has been linked with a move to Chelsea this summer if Arsenal cannot secure fresh terms.But Wenger is adamant the playmaker has his heart set on remaining in north London. Basically, he wants to stay at the club and it s down to finding an agreement with his agent, Wenger said. The players first have to see if they are happy at the club, then they have to find an agreement. Chelsea are said to be eyeing a deal for Sanchez in case a move for Everton s Romelu Lukaku falls through.It has also been suggested the player could wait until his contract expires and then move across London on a free transfer.The Chile international is also supposedly keen to get assurances that Arsenal will match his ambitions.Striker Sanchez is challenging the Gunners to make the sort of major improvements which could convince him to stay and be successful or face him running down his contract and then moving across London to Chelsea as a free-agent after next season.The Chilean star is very happy in London, his home for almost three years since moving from Barcelona in a 30million-plus deal, and knows Antonio Conte s champions-elect are interested but privately believes Arsenal will not sell him to a direct rival.It is a clear warning to the Gunners that they must make a clear statement of intent to stop being also-rans in the title race and Champions League if they want to keep their best player away from Stamford Bridge.Perennial French champions Paris Saint-Germain and Italy s top dogs Juventus are also very keen, and the North Londoners would rather sell abroad if they feel Sanchez will not sign a new contract. &#8211; The Mirror.
