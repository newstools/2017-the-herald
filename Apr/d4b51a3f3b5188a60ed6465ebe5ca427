Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZRP FC are crying foul after they were handed their first defeat of the season in the ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League championship race by a stubborn Karoi United at Chikangwe. The police outfit briefly walked off the pitch after the referee failed to control both the crowd and the players after he had awarded the home side a penalty.Play was stopped for more than 10 minutes.The ZIFA Northern Region administrators are still waiting for the referee s match report.Posting on their official Facebook page yesterday, ZRP FC said they were robbed in Karoi by the referee. He (the referee) was so embarrassed to restart the match after the penalty that he forgot to blow his whistle for the restart and spent a good 10 minutes justifying his actions to the players. He then blew to end the match and said we refused to play, when all the players were in their positions waiting for the whistle. Not that I care if we are going to lose the points, but I just wonder how people go to sleep after such shameful acts. Our referees have become content with officiating at this level and have no ambition to go further. ZRP FC won four of their opening matches and that gave Herentals an opportunity to shoot to the apex.&nbsp;
