Stanford Stix MtizwaSports Reporter BLACK Rhinos are targeting maximum points at home as experience clash with youth in a Castle Lager Premiership tie when they host Bantu Rovers the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. Coach Stanford Stix Mtizwa yesterday said the army side were keen to build on their last victory when they beat Chapungu. Teeming with veterans like Herbert Rusawo, Jameson Mukombwe, Bruce Homora, Sydney Linyama, Wonder Kapinda, Lincoln Saramaya, Benjamin Marere and Lot Chiwunga, the army side have a lot of experience.Rhinos were inactive during the Easter weekend after their match against Dynamos was postponed to make way for the Uhuru Cup. I think the postponement of the match against Dynamos was a setback on our part because we had prepared thoroughly for that game. So this week we had to change the game plan to suit Bantu Rovers. I think we have done everything in preparation for this match and it s now left to the boys to deliver. And since it s a home match, I think it s only proper that we do well and collect maximum points. But it doesn t look like it s going to be an easy match. Competition is always tight in the league. Of course, both teams have returned to the league this season, but we are ready, said M tizwa.Bantu Rovers have a collection of young players who are captained by Zimbabwe Under-20 player Bukhosi Sibanda.Coach Methembe Ndlovu s men received a baptism of fire on their return to the Premiership after losing 0-5 to Chicken Inn in their opening match of the season, but fought gallantly as they went down 2-3 to FC Platinum.They then beat Triangle 1-0.Fixtures Today: Black Rhinos v Bantu Rovers (National Sports Stadium)Tomorrow: Bulawayo City v FC Platinum (Barbourfields), How Mine v Chapungu (Luveve), Yadah v Ngezi Platinum (National Sports Stadium).Sunday: Triangle v Chicken Inn (Gibbo), Hwange v Dynamos (Colliery), CAPS United v Tsholotsho (National Sports Stadium), Highlanders v ZPC Kariba (Barbourfields), Shabanie Mine v Harare City (Maglas)
