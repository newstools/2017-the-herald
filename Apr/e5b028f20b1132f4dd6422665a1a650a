The result had Arsenal s away fans chanting You re not fit to wear the shirt near the end of the game at Selhurst Park, and former Liverpool defender Carragher took the players to task for a lack of effort, The best description of the players was two years ago, from (fellow Liverpool legend) Graeme Souness. He said they re a team of son-in-laws, the Sky Sports pundit said. But what father would want his daughter to bring one of them home? I m serious. Bottling it, cowards, ducking out of challenges. What type of man would you want to bring your daughter home? One of them? Carragher singled out Arsenal stars Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil for the most criticism, saying they have been playing to get away. I just think, from top to bottom this club is not right, he said. The Wenger talk of staying or going. The contracts with Sanchez and Ozil. They ve been nothing short of embarrassing since the contract talk started. ESPN.
