Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter Popular movie joint Ster Kinekor Westgate theatres has closed doors with immediate effect amid revelation that their contract with the complex has expired and the film company has come under fire from movie followers. Just after Ster Kinekor theatres chief executive Wanda Matandela announced the latest development on Wednesday night music fans registered their displeasure at the development. While, it is unfortunate that the Ster Kinekor complex at Westgate will close at the end ofApril. Cinema goers in Harare can still catch all the latest blockbusters that are released on the big screen at our other two popular venues in the city, read the post.Some fans said they could have issued a notice prior to avoid disappointments and bookings. I am quite amused with the news. I enjoyed going to Westgate theatres watching movies. Of late I was there at the premiere of Fast and Furious 8 , which lived up to billing.My point is that I used to plan with my friends and would call them for booking among others but taking us by surprise is taking us for granted. They could have informed us before and what is next.Isn t that they were aware of the contract dates, fumed Tendai Mangofa of Westgate. Another staunch fan from Malbereign, Veronica Moyo said the statement is vague and there is more to what meets the eye. These people know about the contract way before and they should have informed us. We love movies and at the same time, it is said that the complex has terminated the theatres. My query is that, wasn t the theatres bringing business to the complex or what? I smell a rat between the two parties, I think journalists should research more on the issue. How on earth can we not have theatres in this era, she said.Contacted for comment, Ster Kinekor marketing manager Ruzivo Chonyera said the media release is the all information for now. I can t answer further questions, please use the information on the press release, she said.
