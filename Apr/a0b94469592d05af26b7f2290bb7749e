Lionel MessiMADRID. &#8211; Lionel Messi is the best player of all-time, according Barcelona boss Luis Enrique. Messi scored his 500th Barcelona goal with the last kick of the game to snatch a stunning 3-2 win at Real Madrid and put the two teams level on points at the top of the Spanish La Liga soccer table on Sunday. And Enrique has heaped praise on the attacking ace. Messi? He s always decisive, even when he s at home having dinner. He s the best of all time, and I ve seen many football videos. Now, the players are better prepared on all levels and he can make the difference. His (second) goal was also his 500th and he s playing for an incredible club. Leo always creates superiority in the middle of the pitch and we want him to participate as much as possible. Perhaps in more central areas it s difficult because there s more density on our rivals part, but he participated a lot. If you (reporters) want, we ll apologise for Messi deciding the game, which is why he s at Barca. Andres Iniesta has also offered effusive praise of Barcelona hero Messi after winning El Clasico 3-2 against Real Madrid. The Argentine star fired Barca ahead of their bitter rivals in the dying seconds of the game; his second goal in a tightly fought contest.And captain Iniesta admits he s still surprised by his team-mate. I think the true greatness of Leo is that he never ceases to amaze even after so many years, he said. &#8211; AFP.
