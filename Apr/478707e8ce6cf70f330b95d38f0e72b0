Collin Matiza Sports Editor DRAG Racing, the most popular motorsport event in Zimbabwe returns to Donnybrook Raceway in Harare this Sunday with the staging of the first competition of the year under new 2017 title sponsor hp lubes Castrol. The much-anticipated drag racing season takes off with the usual hype associated with Zimbabwe s top motorsport discipline, after a long break since the October 2016 Grand Prix Finale over the rainy season.There will be added excitement in store for motor racing fans on Sunday in the form of several competitors from Mozambique attending the event for the first time ever.There will also be a Sound Off competition hosted by Zimtorque and a Spinning demonstration at the end of the afternoon with Fat Cat and Crew .In spite of the current depressed economy, the Sables Dragpro Club was delighted to welcome hp lubes Castrol as new title sponsor of the 2017 Drag Racing Series, hp lubes Castrol having already been a long-standing partner of the Drag Racing Series and renowned Zimbabwe motorsport partner.The Club was also excited to announce its new 2017 partnership with sponsor Bulldog Abrasives and Auxiliaries.After last year s record drag racing times, more record-breaking elapsed times are expected to be achieved this year as several top competitors pledge to continue improving their vehicles.With more cars expected to run Nitrous Oxide and drags slicks this year, it is likely more competitors will enter the 10-second quarter-mile bracket, a truly impressive achievement for road-going vehicles.On the other end of the scale, Sables Dragpro are also expecting more newcomers this season in the smaller, naturally aspirated classes.Highly competitive Bulawayo competitor, Terry Allberry, in his newly-rebuilt AC Cobra (now blue in colour), will be looking at making his presence felt once again and putting the pressure on Harare competitors.The top three cars (two AC Cobras and the hp lubes Castrol Toyota MR2) are set to keep competition at the top tough.In the bike classes, competitors will have a challenge on their hands to catch up to Les Carlsson s times from last year.Speaking to Mano Zevgolis, the Dragpro Club chairman, about plans for 2017 drag racing season, he indicated that there are likely to be promising developments ahead. For a start, very exciting news is that Terry Allberry (from Bulawayo) is already in the process of rebuilding what will be Zimbabwe s one and only Drag Rail, which will be powered by an Methanol guzzling Chevy V8 small block. When this vehicle makes its debut, it will provide Zimbabweans with their first taste of a true drag car and will hopefully inspire more competitors in the future to take Drag Racing to the next level. Sables Dragpro Club are also planning on inviting South African competitors later in the year, Zevgolis said.Sunday promises to be a great event and a fun day out for the whole family.Admission and registration prices remain unchanged from last year.And hundreds of local motorsport enthusiasts are expected to throng Donnybrook this Sunday to watch the opening event of this exciting motor racing competition.
