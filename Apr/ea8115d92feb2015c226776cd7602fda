Sports Reporter STRUGGLING ZIFA Northern Region Division One side Karoi United have pledged to start collecting points when they meet in-form ZRP FC at Chikwangwe. Coach Levison Selous believe this is going to be their turning point. We have a youthful team and the boys had no confidence in the four opening matches, especially at home, but we have since worked on that. We also had a late pre-season, but we are adjusting and I am now happy with the way we are playing. We were playing so badly at home due to pressure from the fans, but we have since psyched the players and they seem to have their confidence back, he said.Northern Region Fixtures Today: Chitungwiza Municipality v Golden Valley (Chibuku); Cranborne Bullets v Kariba Waves (Commando); Blue Swallows v Mufakose United (Manyame); Trojan Stars v Chegutu Pirates (Trojan); Shamva United v Harare City (Shamva); ZRP Morris v Banket United (Morris).Tomorrow: Karoi United v ZRP FC (Chikangwe); Darwin United v Mushowani Stars (Pfura); Ngezi Under-19 v Herentals (Pfupajena).Central Region FixturesToday: Ivon Hoe Mine v FC Platinum-19 (Ivan Hoe); ZRP Gwanda v Kwekwe Stars (Pelandaba); Makusha v Nichrut (Makusha); TelOne v Whawha (Wilson Fields); MSU v Vumbachikwe (MSU); Chrome Stars v Silo United (Chrome)Tomorrow: Blanket Mine v Tongogara (Blanket Mine); Gwanda United v Black Boots (Pelandaba); ZPC Munyati v Border Strikers (Munyati).
