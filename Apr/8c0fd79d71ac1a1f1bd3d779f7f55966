Janet ManyowaLeroy Dzenga Award-winning gospel sensation Janet Manyowa will release her sophomore project on Saturday April 28 at 7 Arts Theatre in Harare. The album recorded mostly in South Africa will be launched at an event dubbed Worship Night. Speaking to The Herald in an interview, the King of Glory singer said she has a special offering in store for her fans. On the day, we will be seeking to glorify God s name and be drawn to worship him. Through the worship night burdens will be lifted, peace will be restored, joy, healing and salvation will be found, she said.Her handlers anticipate a great turnout at the event, a projection that has seen them shift venues to accommodate more attendees. Due to the demand and enquiries around the event, we had to change the venue to 7 Arts Theatre. We figured that our initial venue was a bit too small.It is a family show so we expect a lot of people to grace the event, said Manyowa.Also performing at the event are seasoned performers like Minister Michael Mahendere whom she performed with on their hit song Kune Muponesi. Other acts on the roster include Bongani Mhlabi, Pastor Gee and gospel rap artiste Prophecy.Manyowa s album comes after a successful debut album that saw her sweep multiple music awards over the last year.She has roped in the services of South Africa based sound engineer Andrew Baird and a trio that works with popular music television show, Idols. She is expected to deliver a high quality project a trait she has maintained since announcing herself on the gospel scene.
