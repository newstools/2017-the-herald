LONDON. &#8211; Arsene Wenger says he would rather let Alexis Sanchez walk away for NOTHING in a year s time than sell the striker to an English Premier League soccer rival. Manchester United are the latest club to be interested in Sanchez, whose current Arsenal deal expires in 2018. Manchester City and Chelsea are also keen.City boss Pep Guardiola has publicly confirmed his interest in a player he signed for Barcelona six years ago and Chelsea want to strengthen their squad as they prepare to return to the Champions League.United, set to part ways with 26-goal Zlatan Ibrahimovic this summer, are also watching developments, with Sanchez currently locked in a contract stalemate after being offered a new deal worth in excess of 250 000-a-week.But boss Wenger insists Arsenal will not sell the 28-year-old Chile international this summer for sure .He says it would not make economical sense to do so and that this situation is different to when the Gunners sold striker Robin van Persie to United in 2012. Wenger said: I don t think that you would sell him to any Premier League club, that is for sure. The question is more, Why would you sell him to another (Premier League) club? You want to be as strong as you can be, and not strengthen the other teams. &#8211; The Mirror.
