Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo receives the new Highway Code today from Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe board chairperson Mr Moses Chihuri -Picture By Shelton MuchenaNyemudzai Kakore Herald Correspondent Zimbabwe has officially adopted the SADC signs and signals, with all road users expected to acquint themselves with them with immediate effect.Motorists, cyclists and pedestrians are expected to buy, study and abide by the new Highway Code that is already available locally.The new code replaces the old Highway Code developed in early 1970s.Addressing delegates at the official launch of the upgraded new Highway Code, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo, said driving was a privilege and not a right.As such, he said, whoever disrespected the traffic laws would have their licences withdrawn.The upgraded Highway Code comes after 38 620 road accidents were reported in 2016, killing 1 720 people and injuring 11 379. To all road users, the upgraded version of the Highway Code is a must-have. It has specific rules for all categories of road users, he said. My Ministry in terms of Section 1 of the Road Traffic Act Chapter 13.11, promulgated the Road Traffic Signs and Signals regulations Statutory Instrument 41 of 216.This legalised the SADC signs and signals, making them enforceable from that date. I would like to appeal to all road authorities, including our own department of roads, all urban councils and rural district councils to ensure that they erect the new signs and signals and other devices as required by Statutory Instrument 41 of 2016 and the SADC design manual. The SADC signs and signals have new colours and signs for pedestrians, passengers and even animal drawn vehicles that must also be equipped with reflectors.Carriage markings have been redesigned to match those in other countries in the region while a four-way stop system has been introduced, which is said to be safer than traditional stop signs or signal-controlled intersections.New signs such as the minimum speed limit signs and no hitch hiking signs are expected to improve traffic law and make travelling on roads safer.More to follow
