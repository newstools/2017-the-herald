Arsene WengerLONDON. Arsenal s furious fans turned on Arsene Wenger and his players as they were humiliated at Crystal Palace on Monday night. Fuming travelling supporters chanted We want Wenger out and you re not fit to wear the shirt during their 3-0 thumping against relegation-battling Palace at Selhurst Park.The visiting fans who had made the journey across the Thames to south London spent much of the second half voicing their disquiet at the team s performance, culminating in a supporter refusing to give the ball to Hector Bellerin for an Arsenal throw-in, players being told they weren t fit to wear the shirt and sustained calls for Wenger to leave.Bellerin sought to meet the Arsenal faithful at full-time following the loss but was instead booed, leading to the full-back turning and walking away before being consoled by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.Earlier in the evening, Bellerin sought to receive the ball back from the Arsenal supporters to take a throw in, and the fans instead threw the ball onto the pitch before chanting you re not fit to wear the shirt. Wenger wasn t immune to the toxic atmosphere stemming from the Arsenal fans, with banners and chants calling for the long-serving manager to depart as Palace made easy work of their London rivals during the Premier League clash.The defeat leaves Arsenal sixth in the Premier League and in huge danger of missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1997, as they trail fourth placed Manchester City by seven points with a game in hand.Arsenal s latest defeat, their first at the hands of Palace since 1994, was also the first time the Gunners had conceded three goals in four consecutive away games for the first time in 88 years.And Arsenal s flops were forced to run the gauntlet after the match as they were each subjected to more abuse from waiting fans as they made their way from the away dressing-room to the team coach.
