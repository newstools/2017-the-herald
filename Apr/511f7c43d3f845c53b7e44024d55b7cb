Deputy Comm-Gen Sibanda was addressing 13 police officers who returned from United Nations Department of Peacekeeping operations in South Sudan, Liberia and Sudan.At least 40 others are set to leave Zimbabwe for South Sudan and Abyei, Sudan on a similar mission.Deputy Comm-Gen Sibanda said the force considered it a humble privilege to join other nations in peace building efforts across the world.He said the preservation of peace and protection of life was the force s constitutional mandate. May I mostly sincerely applaud our officers for the wonderful work they have been doing and continue to do in support of peacekeeping efforts across the globe, said Deputy Comm-Gen Sibanda.
