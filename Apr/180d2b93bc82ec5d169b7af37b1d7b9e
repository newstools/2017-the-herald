LONDON. &#8211; David Moyes has been forced to apologise after he threatened to slap a female reporter, but Sunderland are not planning to sack their manager because he quickly admitted his behaviour was unacceptable. Vicki Sparks, who works for BBC Newcastle, as well as Radio Five Live, clashed with the Sunderland manager following his team s failure to beat Burnley before the international break.Moyes was furious following a question about whether the presence of Ellis Short at the game meant his job was under threat and criticised Sparks after the interview had finished. However, it is understood Sparks was still recording when the exchange took place and although she did not make a complaint, her employers were furious when they heard the audio and accused Moyes of bullying. It was getting a wee bit naughty at the end there so just watch yourself, Moyes told Sparks. You still might get a slap even though you re a woman. Careful the next time you come in. Moyes has been told his job is not under threat at the Stadium of Light since the incident and has also vowed not to quit, even if the Black Cats are relegated. &#8211; The Telegraph.
