The multi-departmental operations, which included the South African Revenue Service and the Department of Home Affairs, were conducted at our land, sea and airports, it said. There were significant successes resulting from these operations in that 101 suspects were arrested as well and a variety of items were recovered/seized. These items included drugs, counterfeit goods, 19 illegal firearms and approximately 362 rounds of ammunition, hijacked vehicles, as well as undeclared foreign currency.
