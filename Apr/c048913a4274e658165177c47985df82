PARIS. &#8211; Carlo Ancelotti led Real Madrid to Champions League soccer glory in 2014 and now he is hoping to dump the holders out of this season s quarter-finals as coach of Bayern Munich. The two giants are familiar foes and they meet for the 23rd time &#8211; a record in European competition &#8211; at the Allianz Arena tomorrow night in the first leg of a heavyweight tie. Madrid traditionally have fared very poorly in visits to Germany and Bayern are unbeaten at home in more than a year, winning their last seven on the bounce before their own fans.Bayern fans will never forget their crushing 4-0 loss to Ancelotti s Madrid in the 2014 semi-finals, however, the result remaining their heaviest home loss in Europe. Having masterminded the Spanish side s run to glory that campaign, Ancelotti was brought in to Bayern to take them all the way in a competition in which they suffered three straight semi-final losses under Pep Guardiola.His opposite number this midweek will be Zinedine Zidane, his former assistant who led Madrid to Champions League glory last season. - AFP.
