We started the league on a bad note and I am very hopeful that we are going to have a very good ending, said Mangwiro. We are not panicking because this is football. I am looking forward to start winning, especially at home, because I want our fans to be happy. For the hosts, this was two points dropped after they failed to take advantage of results elsewhere and move to the top of the table. We did everything we could and it s two point lost for us. We have to keep on working hard and we must use our home advantage to collect maximum points, said coach Norman Mapeza.Former Triangle striker Hillary Bakacheza was outstanding for the hosts.TeamsFC Platinum: P Mhari,E Moyo,W Sitima,R Muduviwa,I Nekati,R Chinyengetere,S Shoko,C Sibanda,N Masuku(W Mhango 58th min) G Mbweti (A Murimba 84th min),H Bakacheza(M Mudehwe 62nd min)Triangle: R Mudimu,R Kawondera,D Phiri,R Hlanga,G Zhokinyu,H Mavundi,T Huwa,J Chivasa,D Chirambamurivo,T Rukanda(L Nhamo 67th min),K Chigwida
