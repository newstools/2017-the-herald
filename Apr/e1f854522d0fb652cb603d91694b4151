LONDON. &#8211; Arsene Wenger has promised Arsenal fans Alexis Sanchez will be at the club next season, regardless of whether or not he signs a new contract. The Chile international scored the winner in extra time, his 24th goal of an increasingly impressive season, as Arsenal booked their place in next month s FA Cup final against Chelsea with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City on Sunday.Sanchez s current deal expires in the summer of 2018 and negotiations over a new contract have been shelved until the summer.Chelsea, Manchester City and PSG have all been credited with an interest in the former Barcelona forward, but Wenger is insistent his star man won t be allowed to leave when the transfer window re-opens. He will be here next year because he has a contract and hopefully we will manage to extend him. He is an animal, always ready to kill the opponent. He will never give up. Arsenal arrived at Wembley as underdogs as a consequence of their recent form which has seen them drop to seventh in the English Premier League table. &#8211; Metro.
