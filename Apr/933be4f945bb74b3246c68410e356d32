He was part of a group of 800 which was the first biggest group to undergo training when Zipra was still building its force.Cde Ntuliki joined the armed struggle at a tender age of 15 and soldiered on and kept pace during the rigorous guerilla training at Morogoro Camp, Tanzania in 1976.After completing the guerilla training, Cde Ntuliki was inducted to the Military Intelligence Department at CGT Camp where he worked as a security officer under the wing of Cde Busobenyoka, who had trained with Minister Kembo Mohadi.The CGT Camp was under the command of the current Zimbabwe National Army commander, Lt-General Philip Valerio Sibanda.During the armed struggle, Cde Ntuliki like any intelligence officer, was assigned on dangerous missions, but managed to carry them with aplomb. Cde Ntuliki was later on sent for specialised training in intelligence in Bulgaria where he was leader of his group.Cde Ntuliki is survived by eight children, three girls and five boys and six grandchildren.
