Dr MhlangaHerald Reporter There is a dearth of information pertaining to exposure to mercury in small-scale mining communities and the attendant health complications, it has emerged. Officials from the Ministry of Health and Child Care contacted by this publication said there were no statistics on the number of people affected.Principal director in the Ministry of Health and Child Care responsible for preventative services Dr Gibson Mhlanga said there were no ready statistics. Institutions could have that information, but we do not routinely get the statistics from the institution since its not a common condition, he said.Mashonaland West provincial epidemiology and disease control officer Dr Gift Masoja said there were no statistics on mercury related illnesses. What we know is that mining companies such as Muriel and Aysher mines send blood samples every year for testing mercury levels for their staff, he said.He said not much was known about artisanal miners, where over 1,5 million people are operating countrywide.Provincial medical director Dr Wenceslas Nyamayaro said some artisanal miners could develop health complications associated with mercury exposure, but fail to seek medical attention.Dr Dennis Shoko who conducted studies from 2002-07 said findings were presented to Government on the dire situation in small-scale mining areas. We conducted comprehensive environmental, health and social impacts of mercury use, especially in small-scale artisanal miners, their families and communities, he said. Not much has been done since to factor in some of the recommendations which include adopting methods that exclude use of mercury in mining and proper handling. A study was conducted under the Global Mercury Project in six countries including Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Sudan, Indonesia, Brazil and Laos.
