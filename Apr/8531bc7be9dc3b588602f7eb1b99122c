Antonio ConteLONDON. &#8211; Antonio Conte has told English Premiership soccer rival bosses Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola: Money doesn t buy you titles. Conte has claimed that Chelsea s climb to the top of the English Premier League this season is proof that spending the most money is no guarantee of success.Conte would also consider winning the Premier League title this season with Chelsea as the greatest achievement of his managerial career to date, with the feat carrying greater weight in the context of the lavish sums spent by both Manchester clubs last summer.In a clear dig at the Manchester United and Manchester City managers, Conte claimed if it came down to spending then their two teams should be the ones battling for the English Premier League title.Chelsea spent 123.45 million on four players last summer, of which three &#8211; N Golo Kante, David Luiz and Marcos Alonso &#8211; have become key contributors to a team that remains on course to win a Premier League and FA Cup double this season.But the Blues were only the Premier League s third-highest spenders last summer, with Manchester City ( 174.05m) and Manchester United ( 149.55m) both struggling to secure Champions League qualification despite significantly greater investment. - ESPN.
