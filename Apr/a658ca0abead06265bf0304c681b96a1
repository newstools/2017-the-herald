Clr ManyenyeniNORMALCY was restored at Premiership side Harare City as Harare mayor Bernard Manyenyeni mended bridges with the Sunshine Boys executive at Town House yesterday. The mayor quit his post as club patron in protest.He cited alleged abuse of ratepayers funds at the club and questioned the logic behind the council s decision to inject $2 million into the football club at a time the City Council was struggling to provide residents with decent services.However, Manyenyeni yesterday said he will back the team after a bonding meeting for the club at Town House. We will sort out our differences as we go along the way. Even if I am no longer the patron as the City Father I have to support you because I am part of you, said the mayor to a thunderous applause from the players. Some people will complain why the team is up to date when other council employees are six months behind, this is what we face but council management is not for players. Your business as players is to perform on the field of play. You are our ambassadors and you should promote the City s brand. We will sort out our differences as we go along but feel very free to perform on the field of play. As long as I am Mayor I will watch three local games and one away game . . . I will one day come for the practice sessions, Manyenyeni said.Club chairman Alois Masepe and his deputy Stanley Ndemera and treasurer Tendai Kwenda attended the meeting.Masepe hailed the decision by the mayor to back the club. What is important is for the club to progress, said Masepe. Everyone goes into the race to win something and we are saying let us fight for everything that s there for the taking including the title, said Masepe.
