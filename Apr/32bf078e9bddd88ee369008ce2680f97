(0) 1 AMBITIOUS Herentals saw their 100 percent start to the Northern Region Division One League end when a determined Golden Valley restricted them to a draw at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. Golden Valley, who are under the guidance of seasoned coach Raphael Phiri, fought hard for the deserved point. Yet it was the home team who had settled down first with Blessing Majarira converting from the penalty spot.Majarira had been upended in the box and rose to fire home in the first half.Golden Valley kept on fighting in the second half and in the 59th minute their equaliser arrived when substitute Ernest Tavazadza capitalised on a defensive mix up to slot home.Tavazadza formerly of Starbill was full of energy all afternoon and could have got the winner in the dying stages, but his effort just missed the target.Despite dropping two valuable points and with it surrendering their perfect start to the season, Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva praised his troops and said he was still happy with the result. I think the boys did well and gaining a point is not that bad as we have three results to look forward to. We put a lot of pressure on them, but they were resolute so we are going back to make sure we are more lethal upfront as we prepare for Ngezi Platinum Stars U-19 this weekend, said Mutiwekuziva.Former Eiffel Flats coach Phiri was not amused by the match officiating. I think we have a lot of work the referees did not do justice as every decision was against us, but I am happy with the result, said Phiri.Other Results:Kariba Waves 1, Chitungwiza Municipality 2; Mufakose United 1, Cranborne Bullets 0; ZRP FC 2, ZRP Morris 1; Banket united 3, Shamva United 0; Harare City Cubs 2, Trojan Stars 1; Chegutu Pirates 2, Blue Swallows 0; Mushowani Stars 0, Karoi United 0.
