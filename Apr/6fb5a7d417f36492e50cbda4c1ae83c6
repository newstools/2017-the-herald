Helmut MartinEllina Mhlanga Sports Reporter INTERNATIONAL Handball Federation instructor Helmut Martin wants to see continuity of development programmes that would have been initiated to grow the sport and believes Zimbabwe has the potential to climb up the ladder. Martin arrived in the country from Germany on Thursday for Handball at School Courses in Harare, Kadoma and Bulawayo, running for the next nine days with the one in Harare already underway.The three-day course for coaches and teachers from Harare, Manicaland, Mashonaland Central and Mashonaland East began yesterday at Girls High School with 46 participants in attendance while more where still expected to make them 60.The course is part of the international federation s efforts to develop handball at grassroots level hence the deliberate move to capacitate school teachers with the basics of the sport.Having been to different countries before on the same mission, Martin, who is conducting his first course here, said the fruits of his visit can only be realised if there is continuity. It s different in some countries because they continue my work. In other countries I think they have forgotten that I was there, said Martin.
