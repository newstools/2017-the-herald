A few months after getting married to Joyce (Retired Group Captain), they turned their Waterfalls house into a sanctuary for the extended family, said Dr Muzvuru. Their home was a transit point for relatives coming to the city looking for opportunities in Harare. James touched the hearts of many and he would do his best to assist relatives. Dr Mazvuru said the late national hero encouraged many people to pursue their dreams and encouraged his wife to further her studies to Masters Degree. He also provided for other members of the community, he said. After a tour of duty outside the country, James brought five tonnes of textbooks for donations to schools in his home district in Bikita. We are happy as a family that he has been accorded the status of a national hero. We pay tribute to President Mugabe for this honour. Minister of Welfare Services for War Veterans, War Collaborators, Ex-Political Detainees and Restrictees Cde Tshinga Dube, said Brig Gen Murozvi was a dedicated man, whose love was not only for his family, as he worked hard for the development of the country until his demise. This man gave his life for the liberation of our country and he worked so hard to build the Defence Forces that we are proud of today, he said. He has also been posted to various missions as a defence attach in other countries. He was now working under me in our Ministry and worked hard for the good welfare of war veterans and worked well with many people. This is the reason why many people have come for this huge send off. Zanu-PF youth leader, Cde Kudzanai Chipanga, said the death of Brig Gen Murozvi was a huge loss, not only to his immediate family, but to the nation. It s not only a loss to his family, but also to Zanu-PF youths, he said. He is a testimony that we should work for the development of the nation. The youths can learn a lot from such hard working cadres. We can look up to him as a good example.
