Simbarashe NdungwaTawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent Upcoming gospel musician Simbarashe Ndungwa has released his debut album Vana Vekutenda . Ndungwa believes the album will do justice to the gospel fraternity. He engaged producer Laiton Ngolomi who is arguably the best gospel producer in the country. This is my first album to record and I just hope people will find time to listen and appreciate my music, he said.Ndungwa grew up in Buhera, Muzokomba village where he did his primary and secondary education. Though talented he could not dream of recording any album despite regularly rubbing shoulders with established musicians like Taruvinga Manjokota known as Sugar Sugar and Knowledge Kunenyati. These musicians were my neighbours and could regularly meet them when they come home but it was not in me and I could not engage them, he said.Ndungwa, a member of Zaoga church said he then dreamt that he was an evangelist. When I got that dream I started working on my album because God had revealed that to me, he said.Still, there was not much he could do because he had no money for recording. After penning the songs I could not take them anywhere because I had limited finance. I am happy that I managed to record and the album is ready for the market, he said.He recently performed at Dr Ezekiel Guti birthday and received an overwhelming response. That was my best experience and it boosted my confidence. I have session artists that I am working with now and I am happy that they are doing well, he said.He was currently working on videos that will be released in August. I am trying to do the best in terms of the videos. We are taking time to work on them. I am grateful that there are individuals who are willing to work with me, he said.The album has several songs Zaoga , Mhururu Nemheterwa , Ndokudai , Pemberai Hondo and Handirambi Kutumwa .
