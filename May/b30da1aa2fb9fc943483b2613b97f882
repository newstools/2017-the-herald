GLASGOW. Former Leicestershire all-rounder Rob Taylor has ruled himself out of contention for Scotland s summer fixtures. Cricket Scotland says the 27-year-old is unavailable because of a number of exciting coaching opportunities which have come his way . Taylor recently took up the role of director of cricket at Market Harborough and has also been coaching with Loughborough Lighting women s team and taking sessions for children in the Leicestershire academy.Taylor said in a statement: I still have ambitions to play for Scotland and I am hoping for my summer performances to get me in the fold for the winter tours. I ve been lucky for a couple of exciting opportunities to have opened up and I would like to give them my full commitment as I look to develop as a coach. Taylor helped fire Scotland into the 2015 World Cup by hitting 46 runs from 37 balls against Kenya.A Cricket Scotland statement read: Although a blow for the national team s summer plans, Cricket Scotland are hugely supportive of Taylor s decision, and the all-rounder insists he s not calling time on his international career just yet. Scotland face Namibia in the Intercontinental Cup and World Cricket League in June as well as playing Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in one-day matches. wilts and gloucestershire standard
