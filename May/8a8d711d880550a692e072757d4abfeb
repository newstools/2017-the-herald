LEICESTER. &#8211; Harry Kane has backed Tottenham Hotspur to shake off their reputation as title chokers and finally win the English Premier League next season. Mauricio Pochettino s side came up short in the title race for the second successive year after Chelsea repelled their determined challenge in the same way Leicester City frustrated them 12 months ago. Deposed champions Leicester are Tottenham s next opponents at the King Power Stadium tonight, but Kane s thoughts are already turning to next term.Watching Chelsea s jubilant players celebrate their title triumph was a painful experience for Tottenham striker Kane, who once again has more than 20 goals to his credit without winning a major trophy.Even so, Kane is convinced it will be Tottenham s turn to hoist the silverware sooner rather than later because Pochettino has built a gifted group that revels in the team-first ethos preached by their manager. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
