Paul Mundandi in Mhondoro Ngezi Platinum &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.(2) 2ZPC Kariba &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; (1) 1 MIDFIELDER Walter Mukanga scored easily the fastest goal so far in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League when it took him just 23 seconds to find the target as Ngezi Platinum edged ZPC Kariba in a lively encounter at Baobab yesterday.Former Dynamos man Mukanga got to the end of a low cross from the left by Terrence Dzukamanja to side-foot the ball home with the goal catching the ZPC defence by surprise as it came before three quarters of the players on the pitch had even touched the ball.ZPC drew level in the 27th minute when Raphael Manuvire capitalised on a monumental Partson Jaure blunder but the home team made sure of the points and climbed into third place when Tichaona Mabvura grabbed the winner on the stroke of half-time.Dzukamanja capitalised to charge for the kill when Tawanda Nyamandwe lost his footing inside his own half and the Ngezi striker picked out Mukanga with a fine assist which left the latter with an easy task of slotting past the exposed Tendai Hove.ZPC Kariba then found their way back via a huge defensive error by Jaure who made a feeble back header intended for goalkeeper Takabva Mawaya but an alert Manuvire raced in to place the ball beyond the drawn out goalkeeper.A minute after ZPC Kariba had equalised, Mukanga thought he had found his brace and Ngezi s second of the afternoon but the effort was ruled offside. Sunday Mhofu Chidzambwa must have been left disappointed with the manner in which his ZPC Kariba defended especially from the flanks where they were giving the hosts too much space.It was from the flank that Ngezi Platinum got their winner after man of the match Donald Spanner Teguru set up Mabvura with a cross to bury the ball home past Hove.Veteran left back Qadr Amin could also have had his name on the score sheet in the 78th minute when he was fed in the box by Liberty Chakoroma but he directed his effort to the skies with Hove at his mercy.With Teguru, Mabvura, Dzukamanja and Mukanga enjoying a good outing,Ngezi s victory took them to just a point behind new leaders Black Rhinos with 20 points after nine matches.Chidzambwa, who has built his teams around a philosophy of solid defending was disappointed with the manner in which they capitulated at Baobab. We did not come to the party. We lost concentration and conceded easy goals. I am disappointed and we need to go and start afresh. We need to go back to the drawing board. I was, however, not impressed by Ngezi conduct.
