Samuel UndengeTatenda Charamba Herald Reporter The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has been hailed for ensuring improved service delivery through effective risk management. This was said by Minister of Energy and Power Development Dr Samuel Undenge during the power utility s annual risk management awards ceremony, which ran under the theme: Rewarding risk compliance: A key factor for sustainable electricity supply. In a speech read on his behalf by permanent secretary in the ministry, Mr Partson Mbiriri, Minister Undenge said risk management always yielded good results. We take pride as your ministry and Government that as a nation we did not experience load shedding in the past 15 months, said Dr Undenge. This is a result of good risk management practices. He said electricity was essential in improving the country s economy and that Government was working towards improving electricity supply in the country. Electricity to the economy is like blood to the body, said Dr Undenge. Every effort made to protect the growth and sustenance of electricity supply should be recognised and rewarded. Now that we have managed to curtail load shedding, we need to maintain that position by improving internal generation by the existing plants, seeing through the expansion projects already under way, strengthening the national transmission capacity and harnessing available supply within the region. Executive officer of Cell Insurance Company Mr Ish Makuzwa said insurance enabled all companies to successfully implement risk management. Insurance allows equipment to be always available, thereby promoting productivity that boosts the economy of the country, he said.The overall winner under the Zimbabwe Power Company was Kariba Power Station.
