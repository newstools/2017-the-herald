Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter HARARE S Friendly Soccer Academy, in conjunction with France-based Foot Brezh Academy, will offer a rare opportunity for aspiring local young footballers when they hold some trials that may see some of them going to Europe for exchange programmes in October. The trials for the kids above 12-years will begin this morning at Raylton Sports Club.The interested players will be training under Patridge Muskwe and a French football scout Yanik Salomon who is in the country for one week.Salomon, who owns Foot Brezh Academy, is hopeful he can get some good talented players.He has links with French clubs like Ligue 1 giants Lyon, Brest and Lorient. I have been involved in this for over six years and I have developed contacts. I even have contacts with Manchester United, Salomon said.Former national Under-17 coach Muskwe, who has passion of grooming young talent through his Friendly Academy, believes the latest development will go a long way for both parties. We will never go anywhere if we base with South Africa as a destination for our stars. Our players need to be exposed to Europe at an early age and that is what we are trying to achieve through this partnership. For Zimbabwe to qualify for the World Cup we need players to be exposed to the game s highest levels and those levels are in Europe, said Muskwe.The partnership was supported by Mama s and Farmgold who work together with Friendly Academy and their representatives believe this is a good start for both parties. We are happy for Friendly Academy as we have been working together for some time and we provide facilities like the gym for the technical team and we hope this will bring positive results, they said.
