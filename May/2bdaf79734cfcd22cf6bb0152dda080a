KARACHI. &#8211; As Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq head off into the sunset after long and illustrious cricket careers, Pakistan begins a tricky period of transition looking for a new wave of players ready to fill a huge void left by the retired batting greats. In a fitting finale, Younis, Pakistan s most prolific Test run-scorer, and Misbah, the country s most successful captain, bowed out together in a blaze of glory on Sunday with the team celebrating a first-ever series triumph in the Caribbean.The thrilling 101-run victory in Dominica sealed a 2-1 win over West Indies and was Pakistan s 26th under the 42-year-old Misbah, who also led the side to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) world Test rankings last year.Since his 2001 Test debut in New Zealand, Misbah accumulated 5 222 runs in 75 matches at an average higher than 46. Admired for his unflappable temperament in a dressing room replete with mercurial talent, Misbah was handed the Test captaincy after a 2010 spot-fixing scandal in England led to the expulsion of his predecessor Salman Butt.ICC chief executive David Richardson was among those to pay a glowing tribute to the consistent right-hander. Misbah has been the bedrock of many a Pakistan innings, time and time again extricating his team from difficult situations with a terrific temperament, the former South Africa wicket-keeper said. &#8211; Reuters.
