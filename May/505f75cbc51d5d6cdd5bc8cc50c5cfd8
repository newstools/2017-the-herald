The say it may be a drop in the ocean, but the ocean is made of many dropsQ: What attracted you to work for Capitalk FM?A: To be honest, I wasn t sure I would get it, but I thought I should at least try. I d been wanting to use multiple media platforms to engage people in the discussions that we tend to have in our small clusters.Zimbabweans love to talk, to share ideas, and we all know something that could meaningfully contribute to changing the world, so I wanted to find different platforms in which we can all contribute and co-create our vision, plan and policies for moving forward. When I saw the advert I just figured, why not, it could be interestingQ: Do you have any key mentors or people who deeply influenced who you are, what you believe in and what you re committed to in your work and life?A: Yes, there are many people who inspire me and have shaped my life in many different ways. I believe that everyone who comes into your life will contribute something to you, it s just about finding the good in everyone and learning from them.Q: What sets you apart from other people in the media industry?A: I suppose my background as a development practitioner makes me a little unusual in the media landscape, but I suppose the thing that sets me apart would be my spectacles, I haven t seen anyone yet with the same kind.Q: What do you do in your free time?A: I m always trying to learn new things and share them. The biggest things I am working on currently though are my PhD proposal and I m hoping maybe one day I ll actually write my very first academic paper for publishing.Q: If you are sitting where you are a year from now celebrating what a great year it s been for you at Capitalk FM, what have you achieved?A: I think we would have more people in Harare having complex conversations in public spaces, problem solving, with abstract intellectual thought shaping the development of Harare and Zimbabwe.
