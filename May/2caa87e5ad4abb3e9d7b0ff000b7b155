Wayne SibandaWalter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau A Lion s Den family is appealing for financial assistance to raise $10 000 for five-year-old Wayne Sibanda to undergo heart surgery in India. Wayne has a 3,8mm perforation on the heart which needs to be corrected through surgery and time is running out.His father, Mr Innocent Sibanda, said doctors have indicated that the corrective surgery needs to be undertaken in the shortest possible time. Wayne was diagnosed with a rare condition of having a hole on his heart which needs to be closed through surgery, said Mr Sibanda. We are appealing to Zimbabweans to extend a helping hand in raising $10 000. The required $10 000 will cover bookings in India, airfares, medication and the procedure.Wayne was diagnosed at the Diagnostic Heart Centre after suffering a high body temperature before collapsing sometime in June last year.He has collapsed several times ever since and doctors say corrective surgery needs to be undertaken urgently. When it first happened we thought it was malaria or an ordinary flu bug but after several tests it was established that he has a hole in his heart, said Mr Sibanda.As a result of the condition, Wayne has stunted growth and regular episodes of losing strength which leads to collapsing.Those willing to assist can do so through EcoCash numbers 0773518435 (Innocent Sibanda), 0772706494 (Tendai Sibanda) or POSB Chinhoyi branch account number 300310023894.
