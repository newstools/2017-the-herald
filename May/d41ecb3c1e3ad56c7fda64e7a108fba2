LONDON. German soccer giants Bayern Munich have become the latest European superpower to register their interest in Alexis S nchez, one of those few players at the elite level who looks readily available this summer and capable of making an impact at any of the Champions League big-hitters. English Premiership side Manchester City also want Sanchez to hold his nerve if Arsenal try to force the want-away Chile winger to a foreign club.City believe they are in pole position to sign the 28-year-old following his refusal to sign a new contract at the Emirates.But boss Pep Guardiola s hopes of being reunited with a player he coached at Barcelona hinge on Sanchez making sure the Gunners don t try to save face by forcing him to move abroad.Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain both have a strong interest in the former Udinese star.And Arsenal would prefer to sell 60million-rated Sanchez in a cut-price deal to a continental club rather than allow him to follow Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Bacary Sagna in the great exodus from the Emirates to the Etihad.Arsene Wenger has insisted that he would rather force the winger to serve the remaining 12 months of his contract and lose him for nothing in 2018 rather than sell him to a Premier League rival like City, Chelsea or Manchester United. But City are aware of Sanchez s admiration for Guardiola and they reckon the Chilean s contract stand-off will see them seal a deal that will cost no more than 40million. The Telegraph
