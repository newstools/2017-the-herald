Pelele Bridge in Ntalale, Gwanda North, which cost $70 000, and Mlambapheli Bridge in Halisupi, Gwanda South, built at a cost of $45 000, were constructed with the help of free labour from communities.Some of the participants were paid with grain by the Department of Social Welfare under the Food for Assets programme. Commissioning the two bridges on Tuesday this week, the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Dr Joram Gumbo, said the construction of the bridges enhanced the Command Agriculture programme, as they ensured speedy delivery of inputs to farmers. Secondly, the extension work in both crop and livestock will be enhanced by this connectivity, he said. Thirdly, economic activities will also improve due to accessibility to markets and ease of moving commodities closer to communities. Generally, the deployment of qualified personnel will ensure quality services to these communities and beyond. Matabeleland South Minister of Provincial Affairs Cde Abednigo Ncube said the construction of the bridges would allow people to engage in income-generating projects.Speaking at the same occasion, DDF Matabeleland South provincial coordinator Mr Douglas Dube said: Labour was for free and some of the members were coming from the Food for Assets programme where Social Welfare provided grain. So, in brief, the bridges were a product of the programme.
