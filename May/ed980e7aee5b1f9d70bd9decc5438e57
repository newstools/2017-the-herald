WATFORD. Yaya Toure says he wants to remain at Manchester City until he retires from football. Toure (34) is out of contract with City in the summer and is yet to find out if he will be offered a new deal, although club sources have told ESPN that there is a strong chance he will be offered an extension. The former Ivory Coast international is one of seven City players whose contracts expire this summer and manager Pep Guardiola told a news conference following the 5-0 victory over Watford on Sunday that a decision on their futures will be revealed soon.Toure says he can play on for two or three more seasons and insists he is capable of doing a job for Guardiola s side. I just want that when I finish I can finish with City. That s what I want, but we will see, Toure told reporters. You know my intention is not bad. It s just about the fans, the club all the time I go on the pitch I m always grateful. ESPN.
