KABUL. At least 20 Afghan policemen were killed early yesterday when Taliban fighters stormed multiple security outposts in the volatile southern province of Zabul, officials said, as the insurgents escalate their annual spring offensive. Local officials made desperate calls to Afghan television stations to seek attention as they were unable to get hold of senior authorities for help, highlighting the disarray in security ranks.The coordinated attack is another stinging blow to NATO-backed Afghan forces.It comes just a month after the Taliban killed at least 135 security forces in northern Balkh province, in the deadliest insurgent attack on an Afghan military base. This morning, a group of Taliban fighters armed with heavy and light weapons launched coordinated attacks on several police checkpoints in Shah Joy district of Zabul province, killing 20 policemen, provincial governor Bismillah Afghanmal told AFP.A district official told AFP that at least 15 others were wounded in the fighting.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on their website. The raid, the latest in a series of brazen Taliban assaults, underscores the insurgents growing strength more than 15 years since they were ousted from power by the US invasion of 2001.Taliban militants launched their annual spring offensive in late April, heralding a surge in fighting as the US tries to craft a new Afghan strategy and NATO considers sending more troops to break the stalemate against the resurgent militants.The offensive normally marks the start of the fighting season, though this winter the Taliban continued to battle government forces.US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis last month warned of another tough year for security forces in Afghanistan.His comments came after Taliban fighters dressed in army uniforms and armed with suicide vests attacked a military base outside the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif last month, killing at least 135 policemen and soldiers.
