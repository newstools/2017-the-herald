BARCELONA. Valtteri Bottas seeks to prove his maiden Formula One success at Sochi was no fluke by repeating the feat for champions Mercedes in this weekend s Spanish Grand Prix. The unflappable Finn, who has emerged as a serious threat not only to his more celebrated team-mate Lewis Hamilton, but also Ferrari s championship leader Sebastian Vettel, believes his determination, form and speed justify his optimism. Getting that win has definitely given me a lot of confidence that I can do it because I always thought that I had the ability. And now it s done all I want to do is to go and win again and again, said Bottas.Another Bottas win would not be a surprise at a venue that has a habit of producing more different winners than anywhere else if he is successful, he will be the 11th different winner in as many years.The Circuit de Catalunya, a track drivers and teams know intimately from days of pre-season testing, is capable of throwing up the most unexpected and unpredictable results.That was demonstrated last year by Dutch teenager Max Verstappen s win on his debut for Red Bull.Bottas recent bright form pole position in Bahrain and victory at Sochi has confirmed him as a worthy successor to retired 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg at Mercedes where, temporarily, he has managed to put three-time world champion Hamilton in the shade.But that does not mean much as the teams, all with upgraded packages, begin the European season with Ferrari likely to set the pace if the weather conditions put the onus on tyre management.The Italian team has a car that is less demanding on its rubber and operates well across a wider range of temperatures than the Mercedes.For Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, it is a concern, but not yet a serious worry.
