MONACO. &#8211; Mercedes boss Toto Wolff believes Lewis Hamilton has changed from being a loner to become a true team player this year &#8211; and hopes that it will boost his hopes of taking pole in Monaco. As the Formula One paddock took advantage of yesterday s traditional rest day in Monte Carlo, Mercedes were busy seeking solutions to the set-up problems that saw three-time champion Hamilton fall a second behind championship leader Sebastian Vettel in Thursday afternoon s second practice.Ferrari were doing the same to ensure their advantage was consolidated with four-time champion Vettel forecasting a major fight-back from the champions. I am not counting out Mercedes, he said. They probably had a problem and I am sure they will be back to full force on Saturday. There is plenty of time for them to sort things out. My guess is that it will be very close &#8211; and that the five-tenths we are ahead of Red Bull is not the reality. - SuperSport.
