LONDON. Cesc Fabregas has questioned why he was dropped for Chelsea s FA Cup final defeat by his old side Arsenal. The 30-year-old midfielder started four of the Blues last six Premier League games as Antonio Conte masterminded another Stamford Bridge title success. But Fabregas, who spent eight years at Arsenal before returning to Barcelona in 2011, found himself among the substitutes as Chelsea failed to secure the Double following a 2-1 defeat.Fabregas was introduced in place of Nemanja Matic just after the hour mark, with the Spain international unhappy to have been given a watching brief beforehand. I thought I was playing very, very well in the last few months, he said. I was in great form and it was a shame I didn t start the game. I was playing very well and the team was winning, scoring a lot of goals and defending well. That is football, you have to accept decisions. It is a bad day and a shame because we wanted to win. The most important thing is the team didn t win. Sometimes it is all about the coach s decision. I don t think I could have done much more this season, it is the coach s decision and you have to respect that. Mailonline
