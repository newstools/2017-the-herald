LONDON. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney says he has more or less decided his future at the club. The 31-year-old has played a bit-part role for United this season, coming on as a last-minute substitute in the Europa League final triumph over Ajax. There s lots of offers on the table, both in England and abroad, he said. But United s all-time leading scorer with 253 goals said he would only move to former club Everton if he stayed in the Premier League.Toffees manager Ronald Koeman and director of football Steve Walsh have both said publicly this season they would be interested in the player should he become available. Rooney joined the Old Trafford club for 27m in 2004 and has gone on to play more than 550 games, breaking Sir Bobby Charlton s 44-year goalscoring record this season. BBC Sport.
