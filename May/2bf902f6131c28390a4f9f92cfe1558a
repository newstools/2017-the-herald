The win saw the airmen taking their points tally to 11 which eased their relegation worries after they had spent the better part of the season on the basement.They are unbeaten in five games and they have not conceded a goal. Chapungu took control of the match in the opening stages but fluffed a number of chances but the visitors soon crawled back into the match and could have found the opener in the 25th minute when Nkosana Sibanda broke loose after catching the home defence at sea before squaring to Thabani Sibanda who had acres of space in the box.Sibanda was, however, a shade too slow to punish the opponents.The home side soon found their rhythm and got their opener five minutes later when Allen Tavarwisa beat his marker and released man-of-the-match Ian Nyoni who sent in a cross which was met first time by Chitora.His effort was punched back into play by Tsholotsho goalkeeper Chang Mariyoni. The rebound fell into the path of Maxwell Mavuto but was denied by the woodwork before Chitora headed the rebound home.Chapungu could have doubled the lead in the 37th minute after Ngonidzashe Murisa released Nyoni on the right flank but his effort missed the target. The hosts found the insurance goal in the 63rd minute when Mavuto unleashed a first-time shot which found its target.Chapungu coach Tendai Chikuni paid tribute to his charges. I am happy to collect maximum points especially after our midweek encounter against ZPC Kariba. Fatigue was creeping in and that is why we changed the team today but I am happy that the boys now understand my philosophy and everything is taking shape, said Chikuni.Farai Sibanda, the visitors goalkeepers coach, blamed the defeat on defensive blunders. We lost the match because of defensive errors and we need to work on that going forward because that is how we have been losing our games, said Sibanda.
