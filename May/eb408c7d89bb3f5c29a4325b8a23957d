LONDON. Diego Costa claims he will only leave Chelsea to return to Atletico Madrid this summer, turning his back on long-term speculation of a blockbuster move to China. Costa scored 22 goals this season in firing Chelsea to the Premier League title for the second time in three seasons at the club.Yet, the Brazilian-born striker has struggled to settle in London and had a training ground bust-up with Chelsea boss Antonio Conte in January fuelling rumours he could be the latest star of European football to be snapped up by China s football boom.However, after losing out to Arsenal in Saturday s FA Cup final, Costa said only a return to Atletico, where he won La Liga in 2013/14, would tempt him away from Stamford Bridge. If the club really want to sell me and there is an offer from a different club, I will stay, he said. If the offer is from Atletico, I will think about it that much is clear. I am going to choose my future, not them. I won t change city or country for another that isn t Spain. If the club want to sell me, there is only one team and I have made that very clear. AFP
