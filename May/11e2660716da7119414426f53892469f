Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Reporter United Nations resident co-ordinator in Zimbabwe Mr Bishow Parajuli has urged students to familiarise with Sustainable Development Goals to make meaningful contribution to the country s social services. In an interview after lecturing on social services to hundreds of students from different schools at the University of Zimbabwe yesterday, Mr Parajuli said both students and their teachers had a role to play in the development of the country. They need to learn what is happening on the ground from a social point of view, they need to be familiar with what is happening and their teachers should also contribute by telling them what is happening on the social side and not only the academic side, he said. They must engage with Government and participate in social activities during the course of their trainings so that when they come out they will say, I am going to participate in this or that area . Mr Parajuli commended the University of Zimbabwe, Department of Humanities for organising the lecture, saying it was important for academics to learn the practical side, as well as bringing them to reality.In his lecture, Mr Parajuli explained to the students the importance of social policy in poverty eradication, the country s achievements in various areas, including the recent response to drought, reduction of HIV prevalent from a high of about 29 percent to 14 percent, reduction of maternal mortality and access to education and health services, among other notable achievements.He spoke about some of the challenges the country was still facing in the areas of climate change, poverty eradication and employment opportunities.Mr Parajuli said the country needed to continue with reforms to attract investment and promotion of the ease of doing business agenda.
