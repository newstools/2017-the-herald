AUCKLAND. The All Blacks have plenty of room for improvement and have not reached their potential, coach Steve Hansen said on Tuesday ahead of a three-test series against the British and Irish Lions. Hansen told The Times the squad were breaking in new players and re-establishing themselves after the loss of stars such as Dan Carter. I am very happy with where we got to at the end of 2016, said Hansen. Has it reached its potential? I don t think so. I still think there is plenty of room for us to improve. Clearly we lost a lot of experience and leadership after the World Cup in 2015 so last year was about re-establishing ourselves and putting a marker back in the ground about how we want to be and I see this year as a continuation of that, said Hansen.He dismissed fears that fly-half and rugby world player of the year Beauden Barrett may not measure up to the Lions kickers. I don t think we ve lost a test match through his goalkicking, said Hansen. People are panicking because he s not goalkicking for the (Wellington) Hurricanes. I don t care (that he isn t the Hurricanes first choice kicker). Reuters.
