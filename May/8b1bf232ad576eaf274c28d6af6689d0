When I started Ring Driving school in 2009 I was having the mind of running it just as a driving school but later on I realised that we also need to invest in the arts sector particularly gospel music, he said.I did not personally know Shumba before but because of the values our organisation has we decided to rope him in.They assisted the musician in shooting his second DVD. We decided to assist him on the videos and we are happy that people accepted it, he said.Apart from the DVD the driving school managed to assist him in distribution of the musician s new album My Season . We have three branches one in Chitungwiza and two others in the capital so all those branches were having his music and we managed to sign him on the opening of the new branch here at Samora Machel, he said.Sanangura said as Ring Driving School they were ready to give back to the arts community especially the gospel side.Last week Shumba was among the musicians who performed at the opening of their Samora Machel branch. As you are aware that our roads are taking lives on daily bases as we train these drivers we need to be God oriented so that the trainee drivers also know that there is God, he said.
