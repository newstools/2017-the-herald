Fungai Lupande Court Reporter The South African woman suspected of smuggling cocaine into Zimbabwe after ingested body packs were detected in her stomach is in fact not pregnant, another scan has revealed. Isaura Masinga (40) is charged with possession of cocaine and was yesterday further remanded in custody to next Wednesday for bail application.The prosecutor Mr Michael Reza told the court that Masinga had to undergo a second ultra sound scan because a computerised tomography (CT) is not recommended for pregnant women.The results of the second scan ruled out early pregnancy and detected myometrial cysts.Mr Reza said the CT scan was still required. Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals has confirmed that accused is not pregnant, which means that a CT scan can be done without fear of damaging the baby, he said.Masinga s lawyer Mr Nickiel Mushangwe consented having the matter postponed to May 17.Mr Mushangwe was claiming that Masinga was having a difficult pregnancy , and this was before the State revealed that she was not pregnant.Masinga has been in custody since May 5.On her initial remand, the State applied that Masinga be closely monitored and her stool checked for evidence.The court was not made aware if the State was successful in getting any fresh evidence.The court heard that on May 5 this year, detectives received a tip off that Masinga was arriving at the Harare International Airport aboard a United Emirates Airline EK713.It was alleged that she was transporting drugs and the police were informed that if they failed to find drugs on her or her luggage, she would have swallowed them.
