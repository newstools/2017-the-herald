John Terry raised the Premier League trophy aloft surrounded by his title-winning team-mates at Stamford BridgeLONDON. CHAMPIONS Chelsea became the first English side to register 30 top-flight victories in a 38-game season as they said farewell to captain John Terry with a comfortable Premier League win over bottom club Sunderland. The Blues, who sealed their sixth top-flight title nine days ago, fell behind to an early Javier Manquillo strike but hit back quickly through Willian s angled drive.Eden Hazard lashed in his 17th goal of the season to give the home side the lead before his replacement, Pedro, capitalised on a poor backward header from Joleon Lescott to head in.Another substitute, Michy Batshuayi, ensured the win was an emphatic one with two well-taken finishes late on to end his season with five goals in three games.It was an emotional send off for defender Terry, who left the field in tears to a guard of honour from his team-mates in a pre-planned substitution in the 26th minute, matching his shirt number.Jermain Defoe missed what may well have been his last game as a Sunderland player with a hamstring injury as the Black Cats 10-year stay in the Premier League came to an end with their 26th defeat of the season.The stats behind Chelsea s success this season are impressive: 30 wins in total, 15 victories out of 16 at home, 83 points from the last 96 available to them and 85 goals scored, making this their second-best ever Premier League season in front of goal.Admittedly, the Blues hugely underachieved during last season s title defence, but this has been an impressive and emphatic return to form for which Conte must take much of the plaudits.The Italian has restructured the side, most notably through his adoption of a 3-4-3 formation in the aftermath of September s 3-0 loss at Arsenal, and restored their swagger &#8211; something that was fully evident in Sunday s final fixture.Sunderland briefly went off script with Manquillo s opener &#8211; coming from a Seb Larsson free-kick &#8211; but once Willian had restored parity there was only ever going to be one winner.Playing within themselves, Chelsea were still way too good for the Black Cats, fashioning 28 shots to their opponent s seven. The only surprise was that they did not take more of them prior to the floodgates opening late on thanks to Hazard, Pedro and Batshuayi.The latter s late-season contribution is further proof that all is well at Stamford Bridge right now. Restricted to cameo appearances for much of his first season in England, the Belgian striker has shown in the last three games he is capable of replacing Diego Costa, who continues to be linked with a summer move to China.The Blues still have the chance to make Conte s debut season a double-winning one when they take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley next Saturday.Stamford Bridge was adorned with banners dedicated to captain Terry, many of them hailing him as the Blues captain, leader and legend .Since making his debut as a late substitute in a League Cup tie against Aston Villa in October 1998, the centre-back has become synonymous with the Blues, and in the Roman Abramovich era he has been their standout academy player amongst a raft of big-money recruits.His 26th-minute substitution, which halted the game while he was given a guard of honour by his own team, was of his own design as a fitting way to say goodbye to the club that has been his home for 22 years.His real parting moment, though, came after full-time when he and his natural successor as Blues captain, Gary Cahill, held aloft the Premier League trophy &#8211; the 15th major trophy the 36-year-old has won during his time at the club.Addressing the crowd, Terry said: Today is one of the most difficult days of my life. I ve been very fortunate to work with some unbelievable players and managers throughout my career. I m thankful to every single one of them. We all have to thank Roman Abramovich. I d like to thank him and all the board. He s the best owner in world football. Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years despite a 3-1 win over Everton on the final day of the Premier League.The Gunners began the day a point behind fourth-place Liverpool and were on course to displace the Reds when they took an eighth-minute lead.But Liverpool, needing a win to ensure fourth, broke Middlesbrough resistance just before the break, and won 3-0.Manchester City claimed third with a very easy 5-0 win at Watford.Arsenal s remarkable run of qualifying for the Champions League in 19 consecutive seasons came to its widely anticipated end yesterday.Hope grew among the home support when Hector Bellerin gave the Gunners an early lead and news filtered through that Liverpool were struggling against the relegated Teessiders.But in first-half stoppage time Georginio Wijnaldum put the Reds ahead with a stunning strike, and Jurgen Klopp s men eventually ran out comfortable winners.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: It is annoying but we had a spell during the season that was difficult and it was difficult for me in my personal situation. We were playing in a hostile environment. The players came back stronger in the last two months and I m very proud of them for doing that. The Reds will play in the Champions League for the first time since the 2014-15 season. Liverpool suffered from early nerves at Anfield before Wijnaldum s opener on the stroke of half-time eased the tension.Philippe Coutinho added a second after the break with a free-kick, and Adam Lallana slotted in to make it 3-0.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said : We ve had bigger games &#8211; this was the game of the season though. We had this pressure but we are Liverpool and have to deliver. Everyone knows where we missed out on points, but we will improve. BBC.
