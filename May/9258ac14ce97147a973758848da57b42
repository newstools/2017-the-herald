Jose MourinhoMANCHESTER. &#8211; Manchester United will field a weakened team for their last English Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace if they qualify for the Europa League final, manager Jose Mourinho has said. Fifth-placed United are a point and a place behind Manchester City and their qualification for next season s Champions League through a top-four finish depends on either City or third-placed Liverpool slipping up in their remaining games.With four league matches left, United are yet to play second-placed Tottenham Hotspur and sixth-placed Arsenal but can also book a Champions League spot by winning the Europa League.They face Spanish side Celta Vigo away in the semi-final first leg tomorrow night. If we beat Celta, we have the final (on May 24) and, in this moment, it is obviously hypothetical, Mourinho told the club s website. The Europa League final is on the Wednesday and we play against Crystal Palace on the Sunday . . . so we would be playing the final with disastrous consequences, the Portuguese added. Maybe I can bring (youth team coach) Nicky Butt and his team to play against Crystal Palace and hopefully they (Palace) don t need the game to stay in the division because it would be very, very bad if they needed the points and we played with the Under-23s. Midfielders Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini will return to action against Celta. Fellaini and Pogba will be back for that game so there are a little bit more in terms of options so we will give everything we have, Mourinho said. United travel to Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. &#8211; Reuters.
