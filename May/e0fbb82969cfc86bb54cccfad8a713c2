It is a proper, long-term investment. It was made pretty clear during negotiations that Kolasnic will be playing under Wenger next season. He announced that to the player and his agents, wary that speculation over his future could hinder a deal. Price also believes the deal is a big clue that Arsenal will continue playing three at the back next season.He added: The signing of Sead Kolasinac is an indication that Arsene Wenger, the most stubborn man in football, is finally ready to change. After dabbling with three at the back in recent weeks, the Bosnian s arrival could indicate a more permanent switch as he s an actual, proper wing back, rather than a winger asked to defend.
