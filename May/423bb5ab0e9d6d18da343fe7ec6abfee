Jose MourinhoLONDON. Jose Mourinho took an amazing swipe at Arsene Wenger, Arsenal s fans and their lack of major trophies. Gunners boss Wenger on Sunday enjoyed his first ever win over Mourinho in 16 competitive meetings, but could not resist a dig at the celebrations in the Emirates.Mourinho was also annoyed by Wenger and accused him of trying to influence fourth official Craig Pawson during the game, although the bitter managerial rivals shook hands afterwards. Manchester United boss Mourinho said: Arsenal fans are happy and I m happy for them. It s the first time I leave and they re happy. I leave Highbury they were crying. I leave the Emirates, they were crying, walking the streets with heads low. Today (Sunday) they leave waving their scarves. The Arsenal fans are happy and I am happy for them. It s a big club. You think I enjoy a big club like Arsenal not winning trophies? I don t enjoy. But today I tried to win. Arsene Wenger is not a small manager, he s a big manager, to have that record of winning so many matches is not normal. Normal is win, lose, draw. I really don t care about it today. No problems. We shook hands but during the game I don t like what I never like. He puts too much pressure on the fourth official every time. Wenger s only previous win over Mourinho came in the 2015 Community Shield, when the Portuguese was in his second spell at Chelsea.The managers first met in December 2004 when the Gunners were still playing at their former ground Highbury in a 2-2 draw.Mourinho insisted United were unlucky as he also said their top four hopes were over. Impossible. I don t think so, said Mourinho. The Mirror.&nbsp;
