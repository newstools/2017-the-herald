Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Pool Association, who will host the 2017 edition of the All-Africa Blackball Championships, are looking for sponsorship to make the tournament a huge success. ZIPA currently have a shortfall of over $5 000 after they got some assistance from sponsors and the Government.The tournament will run from August 28 to September 2 at the City Sports Centre.A total of 21 member nations were invited for the event and ZIPA were promised $39 200 from sponsors while the Government may chip in with $20 460, but the total expenditure is $54 460 meaning they will need to raise about $5 200.Taurai Musakaruka, one of the organisers, said the event will help the country in sports tourism and has called on the corporate world to come on board and help the event become a success. This is a tournament that will put Zimbabwe on the map and I am calling upon all progressive Zimbabweans to rally behind our troops. We are calling upon for support morally and financially for us to stage a successful tournament. (ZIPA) led by Godknows Marawanyika (president) and his deputy, Sam Simenti, and their board are working round the clock to ensure that we surpass standards set by previous hosts, Lesotho and Uganda. However, this can only be successful if members of the corporate world and other partners come to the party and also chip in. I am happy to say that the Minister of Sports and Recreation, Honourable Makhosini Hlongwane, is giving the ZIPA board all the support and has been with us from day one. The same also applies to our Sports and Recreation Commission leadership. The focus of ZIPA is to raise the playing standards to match the powerhouses like South Africa, England and Scotland just to mention, but a few.
