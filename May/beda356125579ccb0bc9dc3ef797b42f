TUNIS. &#8211; Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi decided to extend the nationwide state of emergency for an additional month from Tuesday, the Tunisian presidency announced. The decision was made after consultation with the heads of government and the Assembly of People s Representatives (the parliament). Although the security situation in the country is gradually improving, the missions of the security and military forces require the extension of the state of emergency especially in the fight against terrorism, said Ridha Bougezzi, spokesman for the presidency. On February 16, Essebsi granted a three-month extension of the state of emergency, which was originally declared on November 24, 2015, following a terrorist attack that shook the capital Tunis and killed 12 presidential security agents. &#8211; Xinhua.
