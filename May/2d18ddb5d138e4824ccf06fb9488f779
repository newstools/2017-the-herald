BARBADOS. &#8211; Pakistan s opening batsman Azhar Ali compiled an unbeaten 81 as they marginally gained the upper-hand against West Indies on 172 for three in their first innings on the second day of the second Test cricket in Barbados on Monday. Azhar s obdurate 193-ball stay at the crease helped his side plod slowly towards the hosts first-innings total of 312 at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown to stand 140 runs behind with seven wickets in hand at the close.Captain Misbah-ul-Haq, on 7, was also unbeaten at stumps on a pitch already starting to produce some uneven bounce.Pakistan looked set to take a stranglehold on the match when openers Azhar and Ahmed Shehzad, helped by some sloppy fielding, put on a first-innings stand of 155, before three quick wickets brought the home team right back into the contest. &#8211; Reuters.
