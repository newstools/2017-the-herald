SHANGHAI. &#8211; Usain Bolt s imminent retirement is a blow for athletics, but a new generation of Jamaican sprinters is ready to try to fill his golden shoes, Olympic champions Elaine Thompson and Omar McLeod said yesterday. Thompson, the Olympic women s 100m and 200m champion, and 110m hurdles gold medallist McLeod will be among the marquee performers in today s Shanghai Diamond League competition, which will feature rematches of key Rio Games battles.Bolt, the greatest sprinter in history with eight Olympic golds, 11 world titles and three world records, will retire from international competition after the world championships in August. It s saddening that he s retiring, but there is nothing we can do to change his mind, McLeod said wistfully in Shanghai. But what we can do, as young emerging Jamaican athletes, is shine our own lights and try our very best to keep the flag flying high. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
