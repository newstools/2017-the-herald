We are a democratic party and we have allowed all the 21 candidates to battle it out for the seat. What we have done is that those that are going to lose will constitute the campaign team of the winning candidate. This is because we don t want candidates who might be left bitter by the results to sabotage the winner, he said.Cde Mpereri said Zanu-PF was looking forward to a landslide victory in the by-election to be held in July. There will be a nomination court in Gweru on Friday in preparation for the by-election. We are confident that we are going to retain the seat, he said.Cde Chivamba (59) who was National Assembly representative for Chiwundura died at Gweru Provincial Hospital after a short illness.He was declared a liberation war hero and was buried at the Provincial Heroes Acre in Gweru.
