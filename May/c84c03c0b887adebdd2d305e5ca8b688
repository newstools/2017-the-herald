Peter ChikumbaChief Court Reporter Former Air Zimbabwe chief executive Peter Chikumba, who last week lost his appeal against both conviction and a seven-year jail term, is now seeking an extension of bail pending the determination of the fresh appeal at the Supreme Court. Last week, Chikumba took his case to the Supreme Court challenging the High Court decision to dismiss his appeal.Chikumba is out of custody on $2 000 bail, coupled with stringent conditions.He wants to remain on bail and same conditions until the determination of his appeal by the superior court.The High Court is expected to hear the application for extension of bail tomorrow.Chikumba s lawyer, Advocate Thabani Mpofu, instructed by lawyers Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, last week came out guns blazing following the High Court ruling which threw out Chikumba s appeal without hearing the merits.Justice Edith Mushore ruled that there was no valid appeal before the court. She said the grounds of appeal were not clear and specific.But Adv Mpofu accused the High Court of losing its senses by holding that Chikumba could be barred in his own appeal, and in making an outrageous costs award in a criminal appeal without laying a basis for making such an award.He implored the superior court to quash the High Court decision and allow Chikumba s appeal and possibly order for the matter to be tabled again before the High Court for hearing on the substance before a different judge.Chikumba was convicted along with the airline s former corporate secretary Grace Pfumbidzayi and jailed seven years for criminal abuse of duty under the Criminal Law (Codification Reform) Act.A charge of criminal abuse of duty is only applicable to public officers as defined in the country s statutes.Pfumbidzayi, who suffered the same fate as that of Chikumba, is also appealing at the Supreme Court for the same relief.She is being represented by Adv Webster Chinamhora.
