LONDON. Arsene Wenger has called on Arsenal fans to turn out in force for tonight s game against Sunderland rather than take part in a boycott designed to hasten his removal as manager of the London giants. The veteran French boss has still to announce if he will be staying at the Emirates Stadium when his current contract expires after the end of the season.The Gunners have just three games left before their campaign concludes two in the English Premier League against Sunderland and Everton before an FA Cup final newly-crowned champions and London rivals Chelsea.In marked contrast to the Blues, Arsenal have not won the English title since 2004 and Wenger has come under renewed pressure this season with his side in danger of failing to qualify for the Champions League.Arsenal have finished in the top four of every full season since Wenger took charge 21 years ago but, after Liverpool s 4-0 win at West Ham on Sunday, they now need slip-ups from either the Merseysiders or Manchester City to help them maintain that proud record.This season has already seen a number of Wenger out protests by supporters groups, including planes flying over grounds carrying messages urging the 67-year-old to quit and marches before games, with some empty seats visible at recent Emirates fixtures.
