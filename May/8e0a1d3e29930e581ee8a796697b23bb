ZURICH.- FIFA yesterday overturned Barcelona star Lionel Messi s four-game ban from international matches imposed for swearing at an assistant referee, saying there was not enough evidence to support the stiff punishment. The U-turn is a major boost to Argentina s hopes of reaching next year s World Cup in Russia, with the South Americans struggling in regional qualifying. FIFA said its appeal committee sided with a challenge filed on Messi s behalf by the Argentine Football Association and lifted the sanctions imposed on him as a result . Despite the fact that the FIFA Appeal Committee considered Lionel Messi s behaviour as reproachable it concluded the evidence available was not sufficient to justify a four-game ban.In March, the striker was found guilty of having directed insulting words at an assistant referee in a World Cup qualifier against Chile which Argentina won 1-0 thanks to a penalty from the Barcelona hitman. &#8211; AFP.
