NEW DELHI. Holders India will take part in the Champions Trophy next month, the cricket board said yesterday, ending weeks of speculation over their participation in the event organised by the sport s world governing body. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which is embroiled in a revenue-sharing row with the International Cricket Council (ICC), announced the decision after a special general meeting in New Delhi. The BCCI SGM unanimously decided that the Indian cricket team will participate in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, it said in a statement.The squad for the 50-over tournament would be named today, it added.The eight-nation Champions Trophy will be played in England and Wales from June 1. India won the trophy during the last edition in 2013.The BCCI had skipped the April 25 deadline for announcing a squad and threatened a pullout over its dispute with the ICC.This stems from the ICC s decision last month to amend rules so that less money and power was held by cricket s Big Three &#8211; England, India and Australia.The powerful BCCI stands to lose $277 million in revenue over the next eight years under the sweeping changes approved by ICC members.
