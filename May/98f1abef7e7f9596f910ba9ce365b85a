Harare The National Social Security Authority (NSSA) will increase monthly pension payouts from $60 to $100 later this year, Public Service, Labour and Social Services Minister Prisca Mupfumira has said. Minister Mupfumira said NSSA would increase the pension payouts from the current $60 per month to $100 by September and eventually $150 by year-end. We want to give pensioners a liveable pension and we are in the process of doing that. By September we should have increased payouts to not less than $100 then to $150 by December, she said.NSSA was established through an Act of Parliament to facilitate a social security scheme for all employees on retirement.It collects contributions every month to invest in revenue generating projects to fund the pensions.NSSA payouts have however remained a paltry $60 per month, an amount that pensioners who live outside the cities might exhaust on bus fare and related travel expenses alone.The authority s investment portfolio includes money markets, property, short and long term investments in companies as well as in land.
