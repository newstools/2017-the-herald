RAMALLAH. Palestinians are planning a series of actions to draw US President Donald Trump s attention to a hunger strike by hundreds of prisoners in Israeli jails when he visits this week, officials said yesterday. Palestinian prisoners will be on their 37th day of a hunger strike when Trump meets Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank tomorrow.Some have begun refusing to drink water as well in recent days, according to supporters.A series of protests in support of them have been held in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with two Palestinians killed and dozens of others wounded.Activists are calling for a general strike throughout the Palestinian territories and among Arab Israelis on Monday.Supporters are also planning to display three banners in English in Bethlehem addressed to Trump, his wife Melania and his daughter Ivanka, who are travelling with him.The prisoners have made a series of demands regarding better conditions, but Israel has refused to negotiate. We hope that Mr Trump will pressure Israel to accede to the strikers demands, said activist Adel Sabanay.Amin Shuman, who heads a support group for Palestinian prisoners and ex-detainees, said he hopes the issue will be addressed during the meeting between Trump and Abbas because it is important in the eyes of the Palestinian street .Hossam Zumlot, an aide to Abbas, told AFP that all fundamental questions will be on the table in the discussions .The Palestinian leadership informed the American administration of the details of the strike beginning the first day, he said.Some 6 500 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli jails for a range of crimes and alleged offences.
