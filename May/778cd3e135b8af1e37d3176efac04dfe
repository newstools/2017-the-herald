LONDON. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has encouraged his team to relish the battle for Champions League soccer qualification as they look to preserve their top-four place at Watford tonight. Liverpool topped the English Premier League table in November and looked poised to mount a title tilt, but a top-four finish is now the only thing they can now hope to salvage from their season.While they could be out of the top four by kick-off at Vicarage Road tonight, Klopp wants his players to remain mindful of how privileged their position is. When we were first or second in the table and all that stuff, I said the only thing we can do is to be in the battle for the interesting positions at the end of the season, he said. The end of the season is now, of course. It is the last month of the season and we are in the battle. AFP
