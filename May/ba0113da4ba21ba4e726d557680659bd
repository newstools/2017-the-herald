Business Reporter First Mutual Holdings Limited employees have stepped up their interventions under the Employee Corporate Social Responsibility Programme, aimed at alleviate the plight of those in need within the community. Recently they took their initiative to Sipepa, 70km from Tsholotsho Town and 184km from Bulawayo, where they donated blankets and non-perishable items to 850 villagers mostly the elderly, women and children, who were displaced from their homes due to flooding as a result of Cyclone Dineo which affected Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo and Plumtree during the recently ended rainy season.Camp administrator Montobeko Ndlovu, who accepted the items on behalf of the affected, thanked the First Mutual employees for the great initiative which is commendable given the economic challenges currently prevailing. The kind gesture by First Mutual employees is greatly appreciated and we thank you for this humble donation which will go a long way in assisting this community, she said.Going forward, the employees will continue to donate to disadvantaged communities through various ways including cash, non-perishable goods, clothing, shoes and books among other items.Additionally, the Employee Corporate Social Responsibility programme will include home visits (old people s, and children s homes), hospital visits, blood donations and prison visits.This initiative by First Mutual employees complements the FMHL Group Corporate Social Investment programme, the First Mutual Foundation, whose objective is to promote and raise the standard of living of the less privileged.Its flagship programme is one which assists selected children from throughout the country with educational bursaries and necessary ancillary services to reintegrate them into formal school as well as support for tertiary education.As the Foundation continues to gain momentum, its aim is to increase its support in the education arena. In line with this, First Mutual launched a sponsorship programme to support the Reformed Church University through availing a bursary worth $80 000.00 over a four year period with effect from 2017.
