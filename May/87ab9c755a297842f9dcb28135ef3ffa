Kagiso RabadaNEW DELHI. Kagiso Rabada s shoulders are big enough to carry the burden of being a pace spearhead but he is also looking to strike a balance between bowling flat out and staying the course, the South African cricket speedster said. Fast bowlers are cricket s most vulnerable players and South Africans are already fretting over the workload of a 21-year-old who is tipped to lead the Proteas attack for years to come, at least once Dale Steyn heads off into the sunset.While his pace-bowling Delhi team mate Pat Cummins has spent much of the five years since his sensational test debut wrapped up in cotton wool by a fearful Cricket Australia, Rabada has been playing pretty consistently since his international bow.Still, Rabada, who first represented his country in 2014 and turns 22 later this month, reckons his young body has coped reasonably well with the considerable rigours of playing cricket in all three formats. I think the older I get, the hard it will get, definitely, he said in an interview. But I m not there yet. So right now it feels nice, I feel like I can do that. With the ball in his hand, Rabada is always looking for wickets but a parallel search is also on to find ways to ensure he does not burn out. Have I found the balance? he shrugs. I don t know. That s an ongoing process &#8230; There are also some precautions you take to avoid certain mishaps. I think I ve been training nicely, doing what I need to do. I m continuously finding that balance &#8211; how much to bowl, how much to rest and how much to train. Rabada announced his arrival as an emerging talent on the world stage in 2015 by claiming a record six for 16, including a hat-trick, in his one-day debut against Bangladesh.His 71 wickets from 17 Tests further attest to his potential as a future leader of the Proteas attack but at the moment the strapping right-armer has a more rudimentary approach to his role in the national team.
