I think this is going to be a difficult game because Chapungu have not won a match. If there was a time they should be aggressive, it is now. They will be dangerous with every game they play, so we have to be very careful with them, said Akbay.The Bulawayo giants toppled Ngezi Platinum from the apex last week with a 1-0 victory which left them well positioned on 12 points from five starts.Chapungu are coming from their heaviest defeat this season, following a 4-0 flogging by defending champions CAPS United.However, Chapungu coach Tendai Chikuni said they are still hoping to get it right despite a spate of injuries that has forced him to tamper with his side a lot.Striker Raymond Sibanda and fullback Charles Mativenga are still out with injuries while veteran Philip Marufu was yesterday expected to take a fitness test to ascertain his availability for the match. We have been making numerous changes to our team of late because of injuries, but we have been working hard to get things right. It s not going to be an easy match though, facing Highlanders who are in top form. But at the end of the day we are in the league to compete, said Chikuni.Second-placed Ngezi Platinum have a home test against Shabanie Mine.Tomorrow, the spotlight will be on Stanford Stix M tizwa s Black Rhinos, who travel to Triangle.Chauya Chipembere have been impressive on their return to the topflight, with a watertight defence that has only let in one goal in five starts.Triangle coach Taurayi Mangwiro is still expecting a positive result at home, where they are yet to win a match this season. We know that we still owe our supporters a win because we haven t given them that in the first few matches that we played at home. So the game on Sunday provides us with the platform to atone for the games that we couldn t win. I am sure the victory in our last match at Bulawayo City has motivated us, said Mangwiro.FixturesTodayZPC Kariba v Bulawayo City (Nyamhunga), Tsholotsho v Harare City (Dulivhadzimo), Ngezi Platinum v Shabanie Mine (Baobab), Chapungu v Highlanders (Ascot), Bantu Rovers v Yadah FC (Luveve),SundayChicken Inn v How Mine (Luveve), FC Platinum v Hwange (Maglas), Triangle United v Black Rhinos (Gibbo)POSTPONED: Dynamos v CAPS United (TBA)
