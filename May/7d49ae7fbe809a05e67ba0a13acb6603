Proverbs 17 vs 17; A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. Loyalty is one of those qualities that many people struggle with, the ability to protect relationships and grow them. It s the norm for people to not give credence to the fact that when the Lord places people in your life, you must guard them jealously.Everyone who has been put in your life has invariably been placed there for a reason.It has become common cause for individuals to forget their God given responsibility to cherish and nurture the people they have been given.Gossip, back biting and plotting evil in general are unholy methods of taking care of the individuals you have been entrusted with.We often forget that the Lord is always watching us and we get confused and surprised when our prayers are not heard as a result of our actions.We are called to be loyal and gracious, to show the love of God, and more importantly to grow relationships rather than destroy them.Make an effort to be the friend that you have been called to be.Be the bastion of love and Christ like behaviour and show that you are different.As you do this, the Lord will remember the good that you do as you cry out to him in prayer.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on [email&#160;protected]; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
