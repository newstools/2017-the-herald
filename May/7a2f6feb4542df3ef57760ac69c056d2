SYDNEY. &#8211; A controversial commercial by an Australian sports betting company featuring disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson has been slammed by the government for glorifying drug cheats. The 90-second advert by gambling firm Sportsbet introduces Johnson, at a desk surrounded by a medal and a trophy, as the 1988 Olympic gold medallist while attempting to make light of the scene by superimposing *For 48 hours below the fallen star. When it comes to performance enhancement Ben really knows his stuff, which is why he is happy to endorse Sportsbet s new juiced-up Android app, the narrator says, claiming the firm s phone betting application was putting the roid into Android . Australian Sports Minister Greg Hunt blasted the ad as sending a message that cheating s okay and should be rewarded and laughed at and glorified . They re glorifying a drug cheat and they re paying a known drug cheat a huge princely sum of money, he told radio station 2GB late on Monday. So it s an insult to clean athletes and, frankly, my view is they should pull the ad and they should pay the same amount to junior sport as they paid a known drug cheat. Johnson was stripped of his 100-metre gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics after testing positive to steroids. - AFP.
