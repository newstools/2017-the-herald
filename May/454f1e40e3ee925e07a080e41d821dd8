Richard Muponde Gwanda Correspondent Gwanda Community Share Ownership Trust (GCSOT) has built a classroom block at a cost of over $38 000 at Betsa Primary School. The classroom block was commissioned on Wednesday and comes as a blessing as the school had one dilapidated block which was built in the 1960s. The building of a new classroom block in the area comes as a relief to the community because the old classroom block had become a danger to learn from as it had huge cracks and no roof.Speaking at the commissioning, Gwanda Central MP Cde Eddison Gumbo said education was the only tool for development, hence, there was need to educate children to fulfil President Mugabe s vision. The legislator, under whose constituency the primary school is located, said parents should educate their children as it was the only tool for a better life and economic development. We should motivate our children to learn. Let s give them a torch of life. Education is the only doorway to a successful life and development of our nation. This is the reason why President Mugabe built all these schools to make sure we are an educated country; hence, we are the country which has the highest literacy rate in Africa. That s his long standing vision, he said.Cde Gumbo said businesses, especially big mines in Gwanda were told to develop the district from profits they make after extracting the area s natural resources. It s not only classroom blocks that were built by GCSOT, but we have a number of laboratories which were also built in all the high schools in Gwanda for our children to embark on STEM, said Cde Gumbo.Speaking at the same function, vice chairperson of GCSOT and Gwanda Rural District Council chairperson, Councillor Johnson Mangwangwa Dube, who was the guest of honour, said the completion of the project was a clear indication that President Mugabe and his Government are concerned about the welfare of the people.
