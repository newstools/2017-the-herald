The duo performed at City Sports Bar in Harare last night and they take their joint act to the Mashonaland West Capital tonight. The combination of dancehall and hip-hop is likely to bring joy to the joint that has been hosting many popular musicians since late last year.Club Empire has become popular with many music followers in Chinhoyi and surrounding areas for its consistence in holding live shows. It has hosted a number of musicians and Freeman was at the place last week and left fans clamouring for more. Show organisers said hosting dancehall and hip-hop would be a way of serving clients of different tastes. We will have various DJs on rotation before the guys go on stage. Our previous hip-hop and dancehall shows were popular, so we decided to bring the genres together for this show. Both musicians have performed here before and they now come as a combination, said the organisers.Some of the DJs that will be on turntables are Tynash, T Man, MC Baja, Madkays and Danboi. Tomorrow Club Empire hosts an after-party of Miss Cut pageant that is set to take place at Chinhoyi University of Technology.
