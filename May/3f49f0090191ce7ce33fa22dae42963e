Ms PilimeBusiness Reporters HORTICULTURE exports are expected to surpass its peak earnings figure of $143 million by 2020, ZimTrade chief executive officer Ms Sithembile Pilime has said. Zimbabwe`s horticulture sector performance peaked at $143 million in the 1999 /2000 season contributing between 3,5 percent and 4,5 percent of the country s gross domestic product (GDP) and was second after tobacco in foreign currency earnings in the agriculture sector.From 2000, exports dropped sharply particularly in the period of hyperinflation around 2008.Speaking at the launch of the European-African-Caribbean-Pacific-Liaison Committee (COLEACP) Fit for Market Programme, Ms Pilime said with appropriate interventions, the horticulture sector can be turned around for sustainable export growth within a relatively short period of time.She said Zimbabwe s horticulture production had potential to contribute significantly to the country s total export earnings with adequate support. However, horticultural exports have shown a steady increase to $96 million in 2015 from $71 million in 2012, although there was a dip in the following year, 2016 to $83 millionThe Fit for Market programme is aimed at the growth of enterprise in the horticulture sector by strengthening the value chain through capacity building as well as improving the access to local and international markets. The COLEACP intervention will assist in repositioning the Zimbabwe horticulture sector to become a key player in the growth of exports, she said.In a presentation made on her behalf by Mr Never Katiyo, Ministry of Industry and Commerce Secretary Mrs Abigail Shonhiwa said the COLEACP programme would go a long way in complimenting government efforts to resuscitate the horticulture sectorShe said the COLEACP programme which is running from 2016 to 2020 is in congruency with the economic blue print, the Zim-Asset which looks at poverty alleviation, food security and job creation. Horticulture is the new brand in agriculture which has the potential to boost production in the industry, on average a horticulture project creates an additional 25 to 30 jobs per hectare. Last year Government through the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and irrigation Development launched the horticulture and Associated Crops sector roadmap in September 2015. It is my hope that the Roadmap and the Fit for Market Programme will complement each other, she said.Citrus exports peaked at 45 000 tonnes in 2001, but declined to about 32 000 tonnes in 2015, according to the Citrus Export Growers Association.Fruits and vegetable exports have similarly fallen from their peak of 15 000 tonnes at the turn of the century to about 5 000 tonnes currently according to data from the Fresh Produce Producers Association.The COLEACP programme was created more than 40 years ago as an association of companies trading fruits and vegetables and now supports sustainable agriculture development in Africa-Caribean-Pacific countries. It links producers and all stakeholders across the value chains to global markets.
