Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Reporter Government has strengthened its surveillance on all entry points into the country after the Democratic Republic of Congo reported new cases of Ebola recently. Principal director responsible for preventive services in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Gibson Mhlanga said although the risk of getting Ebola in Zimbabwe was low, it was important to remain on high alert. We are aware of the cases in DRC and we have since strengthened our port health activities at all entry points, that is the airport and boarder points, he said. People are being screened as they come in. Dr Mhlanga said they were also imparting health education to travellers on symptoms of Ebola, so that anyone suspected of having the disease was quickly assisted.He said they had also sent communication to all provincial medical directorates and health staff to ensure that everyone was on high alert. So, we are on high alert and prepared to deal with any case that might arise, said Dr Mhlanga. Remember, this is not the first time that we have had to prepare for Ebola, so we have just reactivated our systems we already had in place.
