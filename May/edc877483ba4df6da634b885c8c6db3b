The former Dynamos and CAPS United player, who can play either as a defender or a midfielder, arrived home yesterday afternoon. Machapa, who turns out for one of that country s biggest clubs AS Vita Club, said he made the decision this week because his safety was no longer guaranteed.His team AS Vita Club have an important Champions League group C fixture against Saint George in Ethiopia this weekend.But Machapa was not part of the squad when the Congolese giants lost 1-3 at home to African champions TP Mazembe and also missed the defeat to ES Setif in Tunisia.The club is bottom in Group C without a point. I couldn t continue staying there because nobody knows what s going to happen tomorrow. Some people are leaving for Angola, said Machapa. So I just had to pack my bags and leave. There was no official position from the club regarding my safety. I just left on my own. Our training sessions were safe as we would train at a base with a lot of security since our club owner is an army commander. It is where we stay. I will monitor the situation from here.
