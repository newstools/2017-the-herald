VATICAN CITY. Pope Francis is to elevate five Roman Catholic prelates from outside Italy and the Vatican to the rank of cardinal, the elite group of churchmen who are his closest advisers and can enter a conclave to choose his successor. The pope, making the surprise announcement during his weekly Sunday address, said the men came from Mali, Spain, Sweden, Laos and El Salvador. The ceremony to elevate them, known as a consistory, would take place on June 28.The fact that none of the five are Italian and none hold Vatican positions underscores Pope Francis conviction that the Church is a global institution that should become increasingly less Italian-centric.Naming new cardinals is one of the most significant powers of the papacy, allowing a pontiff to put his stamp on the future of the 1.2 billion-member Roman Catholic Church.The new cardinals were named as Archbishop Jean Zerbo (73) of Bamako, Mali; Archbishop Juan Jos Omella (71) of Barcelona, Spain; Bishop Anders Arborelius (67) of Stockholm; Bishop Louis-Marie Ling Mangkhanekhoun (73) of Pakse, Laos; and, Bishop Gregorio Rosa Ch vez (74) of San Salvador.Since only cardinals aged under 80 can enter a secret conclave to choose a new pope from their own ranks after Pope Francis dies or resigns, the new members will join the ranks of prelates known as cardinal electors .Pope Francis, the former cardinal-archbishop of Buenos Aires, was elected in such a conclave on March 13, 2013 as the first non-European pontiff in 1,300 years.It will be Pope Francis s fourth consistory and he has used each occasion to show support for the Church where Catholics are in a minority, in this case Sweden, Mali and Laos.The naming of a cardinal for Sweden was significant because Sweden is where the Lutheran World Federation was founded in 1947 and because this year marks the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther s Reformation.Pope Francis, who visited Sweden last year, is keen to further Catholic dialogue with Protestant churches.
