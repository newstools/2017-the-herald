Tawanda Mangoma in Chiredzi Chiredzi regional court magistrate Mrs Judith Zuyu this week slapped a Chiredzi man with 17 years in jail after he was found guilty of sodomising a six-year-old boy. The 68-year old man who worked as a general worker pleaded guilty to the charge. I am sorry my Lord, I don t know what pushed me to do such a thing, he said in court. I ask for your forgiveness. Appearing for the State, public prosecutor Ms Moreblessing Rusere alleged that on May 14 this year at around 7.30pm, the man offered the complainant s mother dried vegetables.The mother assigned his son to collect the relish. The accused offered the mother of the complainant dried vegetables and this triggered the mother to send her six-year-old son to accompany the man to collect the relish, said Ms Rusere.The accused then utilised the opportunity upon arriving at his place to sodomise the boy and threatened him with unknown harm if he narrated the event to anyone. You threatened the boy with unknown action in the event that he speaks about your aggravated indecent assault, said Ms Rusere. You then gave the boy some mufushwa (dried vegetables) after finishing the act and he went home. All hell broke loose when the mother questioned his son over the delay, resulting in him narrating his ordeal.In passing the sentence, Mrs Zuyu said cases of aggravated indecent assault were on the rise, hence the State took them seriously.She slapped the man with the 17-year jail term of which three were set aside on condition of good behaviour.
