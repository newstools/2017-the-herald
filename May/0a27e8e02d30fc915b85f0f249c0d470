We had a number of chances but sadly we failed to convert any. The game was tough and I hope the boys will finally strike the right code soon. said Dube.How Mine coach Kelvin Kaindu felt his boys were not at their usual best. We were just an average team today and didn t play like we usually do perhaps it is fatigue as we have been on the road too much of late. The point is fine though as it comes away from home. As for the season it is a bit early but I hope to finish strongly, said Kaindu.Teams:Hwange: T Mvula; C Phiri; G Ndlovu; A Banda; M Mekiwa; A Chuma; C Muleya; W Munorwei; S Gadzikwa; Mcqini Mpofu(J Kaunda 82ndmin); G ZuluHow Mine: M Diya; P Tonha; B Mbiriri; M Sakala; F Makarati; M Ncube; A Muganyi( P Moyo 42nd min); P Manhanga( N Ndale 75th min); T Banda; K Musharu; M Mukumbi.
