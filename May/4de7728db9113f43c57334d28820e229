Africom is one of Africa s leading home-grown telecommunications companies based in Harare, Zimbabwe. Since its inception in 1995, it has become a leader in the integration of voice and data technologies, launching many pioneering applications that help individual and business customers find convenience in their daily communications. As a front runner in the offering of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) services to the commercial sector, Africom has managed to make inter-branch connectivity and long distance phone calls cheaper and easier to manage.The need for VoIP technology arose as communication companies across the world sought to use the power of the internet to help reduce call costs and improve call quality. It became apparent that the signals used to send data over the internet to all parts of the globe could easily carry the same digital signal as communication networks, such as phone cables and satellites.As the name of the technology suggests, it became possible to transmit your voice over the Internet; hence VoIP.In Zimbabwe, Africom pioneered this effort, in a bid to provide customers with both audio and video services.Initially, this technology was solely available from PC to PC, using webcams and microphones to collect the video and audio and transmit them to the other user.However, as the technology market has developed rapidly and become dependent on a regular internet connection, it became increasingly apparent that even individual smartphone users could also access these VoIP services.Africom took advantage of these opportunities and the apparent gaps in the market by developing an application called Guro-o.Since the launch of Guro-o, voice calls across continents has never been easier or cheaper.Long distance calls have now been made possible through this technology which brings with it, peace of mind that one is able to stay close to friends and family, without the worry of enormous telephone bills.Guro-o is an online voice service which allows users to make limitless calls across the world at local calling rates.This application has changed the way Zimbabweans and all Africans alike communicate with loved ones, while at the same time complimenting other telecommunications operators in Zimbabwe and across the world.Guro-o is an application that is easily accessible over the internet and one which is highly convenient.It allows people to call at unbelievably low rates as well as to receive calls from anywhere in the world.As a Guro-o subscriber, one is given their own 08644 number to call from, and these calls are not limited to other Guro-o users only.The beauty of this application is that one is able to call anyone on any number in the world, while enjoying the same low pricing structure.What does one need to subscribe to Guro-o?Very little.All one needs is a smart phone, I-pad or laptop and you are good to go.
