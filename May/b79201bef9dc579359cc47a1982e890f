LONDON. Formula One s new chairman Chase Carey has accused predecessor Bernie Ecclestone of failing to grow the sport adequately during his four-decade tenure. Carey succeeded Ecclestone in January after Liberty Media s 6.4 billion takeover of F1.While the American admires Ecclestone for building the sport into a multibillion-dollar business, he believes opportunities were missed to increase its global appeal. It was very much a sport that got into a habit of saying no too much. I want to be saying yes to a whole lot more, Carey told Britain s Press Association in an interview published yesterday. What is the value of having an idea if the answer to everything you want to do is no ? All it does is create frustration. There are an array of things that weren t done that needed to be done. We felt it was a sport that for the last five or six years had really not been managed to its full potential or taken advantage of what was here. All of us make mistakes and nobody is perfect. Bernie took a business from decades ago and sold it for $8 billion. He deserves all the credit in the world for what he has done. AFP.&nbsp;
