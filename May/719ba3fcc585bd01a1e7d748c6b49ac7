Prophet Makandiwa Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blesses is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. (Numbers 22:6) In this scripture Balak was inviting Balaam to come and curse the children of Israel.The reason why he was inviting him to come and curse God s people is because Balak was an informed person when it comes to spiritual activities.He knew what he was dealing with and what he was supposed to do. Balak knew that it was not a curse that was going to kill the people of God, but what he was going to do after the people were cursed. All he needed was a curse to do the fore-running, there had to be a curse ahead of Balak before he can attempt to strike the people of Israel. Balak needed a curse upon their lives and after they were cursed it would guarantee their defeat.It is a curse that guarantees defeat, failure and poverty in life. Balak needed the people to be cursed before he could fight them because if they had a blessing and he attempted to fight them, they would have victory over him.Having a curse upon your life, any battle you fight you cannot win. That is what Balak understood.Finally, when the people are defeated they end up blaming it on their strategy, weapons or many other things.If people can have a curse upon their lives, no matter how powerful and complicated their weapons are they cannot win the war.No matter the size of the gun he carries, it cannot guarantee him victory when a curse is upon a man. When a curse is upon a nation, no matter the natural resources it has, they cannot guarantee success.All you need upon your life is a curse and everything gets wrong throughout.Balak was not worried about what Israel was carrying, he was just worried if there was a blessing upon their lives.He wanted Balaam to curse them first and then he could fight them, it was a very amazing strategy.He knew that if he fought a cursed people there was no way he was going to lose.Do not have a curse upon your life and attempt to contend with demons or try to fight against the devil.You need to make sure that there is a blessing resting upon you and then you can start any fight because then victory is guaranteed.Be convinced that you have a blessing upon your life and then go ahead and fight. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them. (Numbers 23:21).Balak, with the help of Balaam, tried several times to place a curse against God s people, but he was not successful.God looked at the Israelites and found no iniquity or perverseness upon them.Therefore, Balaam could not curse them. Moreover, the Israelites could not be cursed because they had the presence of God in their midst.Having the presence of God in your midst as a country you should maintain it to a point where even when an enemy tries to bring a curse upon you, the presence of God becomes so real that enemies can notice it.Enemies coming against you can actually attest to the presence of God like Balaam did to Balak. Cursing such a nation which has the shout of a King among them is impossible.You should have the presence of God and maintain it to a point where the enemy will have to know that there is God.There is something that the presence of God does to a nation, there is something that happens to a nation when God is present.If you are in a nation and you are not sure whether you have God, there are institutions in every nation that guarantees the presence of God and those institutions should never be tampered with.The Church of Jesus should not be touched.The church is the only reason why God can be present in a nation. When God promised to dwell among us, He inhabits in the praise of His people and it is only in the House of God where He is praised.The presence of God in a nation is only initiated when people begin to praise Him and that can only happen in the body of Christ, the church.In the book of Numbers we read, what if Balaam had come and God was not present?What was going to happen to the children of Israel? In life, you must not have your enemies visiting you before God visits you.You must not allow the devil to arrive before God arrives.You must not allow even a problem or crisis to arrive in your life before Jesus arrives, whether it is a financial crisis.In the Book of John, Jesus was invited to a wedding at Cana before there was a crisis.They made sure the solution was already invited before the crisis. They knew that in as much as they were organised as people, they were liable to mistakes and there were errors in their organisations.They invited Jesus to the wedding and when they ran out of wine, they did not call for him to come and rescue them because He was already present when the crisis hit.Having God in a nation does not mean you will not have problems; Jesus was present and wine still ran out.Problems will come, but victory is guaranteed when Jesus is present. You need to make a decision to have the absence of wine, but the presence of Jesus.If you are going to hit an economic problem in the presence of your God, victory is guaranteed.Let God be present in your life, any mistake that you make, He is there to correct it.https://www.facebook.com/prophetEMakandiwahttps://twitter.com/prmakandiwahttps://www.instagram.com/emmanuelmakandiwaHelpline+263 4 339 341[email&#160;protected]
