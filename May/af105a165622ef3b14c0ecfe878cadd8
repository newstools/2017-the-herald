Innocent Ruwende Senior Reporter Harare City Council is set to construct two enhanced clinics in Kuwadzana and Hatcliffe, as well as an inner-city clinic by 2018 at a cost of $2 million.Speaking during a tour of the recently upgraded Mabvuku Clinic yesterday, acting town clerk Mrs Josephine Ncube said the city was now targeting two more such clinics, as well as expanding existing ones. Mabvuku Clinic delivered its first three babies by Caesarian Section last week, a procedure enabled by newly installed machines. We are very excited with the progress we have made at Mabvuku Polyclinic, as you have seen our theatre is now working and we have had our first three caesarians and all the other services are now available, she said. Our future plans are that we should have by 2018 two additional enhanced clinics and our target areas are Kuwadzana because of the pressure that is on that side and the second one will be in Hatcliffe. It is our hope that once we have done that we can cover most of the areas in Harare and lessen pressure on referral hospitals, Harare and Parirenyatwa Hospitals. Mrs Ncube said the city intended to start work on the inner city clinic near Herbert Chitepo and Fifth Street, which is being used as a car park.She said the area was reserved for an inner-city clinic which would cater for areas like The Avenues, Eastlea and Milton Park. We will be working on other clinics as well, which will be ordinary clinics like in Caledonia, said Mrs Ncube. We want to upgrade Caledonia because there are a lot of people coming to Mabvuku from Caledonia. We are also expanding Highlands Clinic. We will be expanding other clinics as well so we can cater for added number of patients. Delivery of health services is critical for Harare and if you look at our rates account about 35 percent goes to subsidise health services. We want to ensure our clinics are self-sustaining without necessarily charging prohibitive figures. &nbsp;
