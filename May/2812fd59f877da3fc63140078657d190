SEOUL. A breath-taking revival by Zambia saw them move into the next round of the FIFA U-20 World Cup Korea Republic 2017, coming from two down to beat Iran 4-2 yesterday. Zambia had shown defensive frailties early on and the theme continued as Mangani Banda s miscued clearance fell straight to Reza Shekari who, after a neat stepover, slotted Iran in front.The African champions slowly grew in confidence, culminating in Fashion Sakala rattling the post with a fine header on the stroke of half-time.That progress looked to have gone up in smoke when a rash challenge on Omid Norafkan gifted Shekari another goal, this time from the penalty spot.However, the tide began to turn six minutes later.A hoofed ball by Solomon Sakala found namesake Fashion who cut inside and volleyed low to half the deficit, then drew level with one of the goals of the tournament so far.A lovely flowing move down the right resulted in Emmanuel Banda s flick being slotted home by Enock Mwepu.With momentum flowing fiercely for those in green, Banda put them ahead following a goalmouth scramble before Patson Daka gave the win some gloss as he picked out the bottom corner from 20 yards.Meanwhile, Italy beat South Africa 2-0 to get their FIFA U-20 World Cup Korea Republic 2017 campaign back on track thanks to goals from Ricarrdo Orsolini and Andrea Favilli.The Azzurrini were the superior side for large stretches of the match and deserved their lead after Orsolini tucked away his penalty in the first half for their first goal of the tournament.The Italians were able to build on their lead in the 57th minute when Giuseppe Scalera s long throw-in found Favilli, who guided in a powerful header off the far post and into the net.The Italians now have every chance to qualify for the next round, while South Africa are on the brink of elimination, facing a tough test against South American champions Uruguay next.
