Paul Mundandi in ZVISHAVANE Shabanie Mine . . . . . . . . . . . . . (2) 4 Bantu Rovers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (1)1 SHABANIE Mine produced one of their best performances under coach Takesure Chiragwi yesterday to destroy Bantu Rovers at Maglas.Two headers from Wellington Taderera in the 4th minute and Tinashe Chigede in the 35th minute gave Shabanie a good foundation.Forgotten striker Dylan Chivandire was on target in the 46th minute with man-of-the-match Collins Dhuwa driving the final nail in the visitors coffin after 72 minutes.Bantu Rovers replied through Obriel Chirinda in the 42nd minute. It was a matter of time and the victory shows the work we are doing. It s still early days yet because the league is a marathon, said Chiragwi. Winning one match does not mean we are winning the league and losing one match does not mean we are getting relegated. We still have hard work to do and every player must fight to play because we registered 30 players to do duty. I am very happy with the performance. William Mapfumo, who lost his son on Monday, somehow had the character to play yesterday and was resolute in defence.
