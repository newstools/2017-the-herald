The introduction of Justine Kaunda in the 53th minute injected life into the hosts but they could not find a way past a defence well marshalled by Guthrie Zhokinyu and Kudzai Chigwida. Hwange coach Nation Dube said he drew some positives from the match. Everything has a starting point and the boys did well with the point gained today as they now believe that it is possible to win at home. They played well only that we missed many chances, said Dube. Mangwiro said it was a point gained for his men away from home. It was a winnable game in my opinion as we created some decent chances but still I m a happy with a point as we have now gone for four matches without a loss.TeamsHwange: T. Mvula: A. Banda; N.
