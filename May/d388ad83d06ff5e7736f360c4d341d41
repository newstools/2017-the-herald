Proverbs 15 vs 31-33; The ear that hears the rebukes of life will abide among the wise. He who disdains instruction despises his own soul, but he who heeds rebuke gets understanding. The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom, and before honour is humility. Friends play a significant role in each of our lives. We spend huge amounts of time with them and ultimately they become the people we depend on for advice and encouragement.As I listened to a sermon my attention was drawn to the fact that friends can be destructive in some of the advice they give if their motives are not entirely pure.Different things draw people to bitterness and at times the advice given can be founded on some ill that is centred on a past wrong.Therefore the advice given by friends will not always be correct or it can be drawn from some ill-gotten mischief that, if followed, can be detrimental.As we seek to interact, may we take all the advice that we are given to the Lord. May He ultimately be the one who helps us to discern what is good or bad for us.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on [email&#160;protected]; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
