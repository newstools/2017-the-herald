This followed a donation of a house to the musician by the Zimbabwe Music Awards last week, as recognition of his work in uplifting local music.The donation by Mrs Chinotimba comes barely a week after her husband donated a set of sofas worth $4 500 to the Chingaira family.Mrs Chinotimba said in an interview: I bought this stove because of the relationship between my husband and Cde Chinx. The new house had no stove. They have been using a gas stove since they moved in. When my husband donated leather sofas, I felt it was my duty to help my fellow woman with a stove. Cde Chinx thanked all the well-wishers for their donations. I am really grateful to everyone who donated, without them where would I be? he said.Cde Chinx s wife Patricia said: I am more than thankful to all donors. I thank uncle Chinotimba for assisting our family. She said Cde Chinx was showing signs of recovery. I am surprised that these days my husband is trying to walk three steps a day, she said.
