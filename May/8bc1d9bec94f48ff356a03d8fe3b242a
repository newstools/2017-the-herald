LONDON. A rampant South African fast bowling attack, spearheaded by Kagiso Rabada, extinguished the England fire by taking six wickets in the first five overs and limited the hosts to a paltry 153 at Lord s in the third one-day international yesterday. That was before the visitors, with a composed Hashim Amla at the helm, reached 156 for three to complete a comprehensive seven-wicket drubbing of England.It was South Africa s first triumph in a 50-over-match against England at Lord s.Amla struck 55 off 54 balls with 11 fours and also reached the milestone of the quickest to 7000 runs in ODs in 150 matches. He and Quinton de Kock had South Africa off to an explosive start as they struck 95 runs in 15 overs for the first wicket.A mini-implosion followed, as Amla was bowled off the inside edge by Toby Roland-Jones and Jake Ball bowled De Kock for 34. Faf du Plessis looked out of sorts and was caught behind, flashing at Ball on five.JP Duminy spent valuable time at the crease and struck the winning cover boundary as he finished undefeated on 28, while a subdued AB de Villiers was unbeaten on 27.
