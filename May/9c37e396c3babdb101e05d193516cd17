LONDON. Manchester United predicted a record rise in annual revenue to between 560 million and 570 million in their latest quarterly financial figures released yesterday. United had previously told investors to expect revenue of between 530 million and 540 million for the 2016-17 financial year.Broadcast revenue for the quarter rose by 12.9 percent to 31.4 million, largely due to the Premier League s new bumper television rights deal taking effect. We are forecasting better full-year financial performance than expected and as such have raised our revenue and profit guidance for the year, said United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward in a press release.
