ROME. AS Roma s talismanic playmaker Francesco Totti has confirmed that Sunday s Serie A match at home to Genoa will be his last after 25 years at the club but left his future shrouded in mystery by saying he was ready for a new challenge. The 40-year-old gave no clues as to whether the new challenge would be a director s role at Roma or playing at a different club, something which has always been considered unthinkable for one of soccer s most loyal players. From Monday, I m ready to go again. I m ready for a new challenge, said Totti on his Twitter feed. Roma-Genoa, Sunday May 28, 2017, the last time I can wear Roma s jersey. Totti added: I can t tell you in a few words how much these colours mean, meant and will always mean to me. I just feel that my love for football never fades. It s a passion, my passion. It s so deep I can t imagine not fuelling it any longer. Ever. AFP
