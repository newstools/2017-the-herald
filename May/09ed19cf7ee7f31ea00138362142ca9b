Gabriel JesusMANCHESTER.- Gabriel Jesus return has come at a good time for Manchester City as they seek to move closer to Champions League soccer qualification by beating Crystal Palace at home today. The Brazil striker (20) has made two appearances since recovering from a broken foot sustained at Bournemouth in February. Having seen a goal disallowed in a 0-0 draw against Manchester United, he grabbed a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw at Middlesbrough last weekend after being promoted from the bench to the starting line-up.With Sergio Aguero struggling to recover from a groin problem, there is every chance that Jesus will start again today as City look to consolidate their top-four position. They are just one point clear of fifth-place Manchester United, who visit out-of-form Arsenal tomorrow, and manager Pep Guardiola knows there is little room for error with only four league matches to play.Guardiola s season has hit trouble lately, with those two league draws following an FA Cup semi-final defeat against Arsenal at Wembley.Indeed, City have won just two of their last eight matches in all competitions. The manager, though, has been lifted by the prospect of David Silva s return from a knee injury sustained during the Wembley defeat.Fixtures Today (all 4pm unless otherwise stated): Bournemouth v Stoke, Burnley v West Brom, Hull v Sunderland, Leicester v Watford, Man City v Crystal Palace (1:30pm), Swansea v Everton (6:30pm).Tomorrow: Arsenal v Man Utd (5pm), Liverpool v Southampton (2:30pm).Monday (9pm): Chelsea v Middlesbrough. &#8211; AFP.
