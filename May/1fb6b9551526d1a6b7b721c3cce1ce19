We are also appealing to well-wishers for assistance with resources such as fuel and transport to ensure that the two-day event is a resounding success, said Mr Nkomo.He said an inter-denomination church service would be conducted on June 11 to pray for peace in the country, followed by a sporting event. There will be competitions in football and netball for Joshua Nkomo Centenary Trophy and Mama MaFuyana Endurance Shield soon after the inter-denominational service, said Mr Nkomo.Dr Nkomo led successive nationalist movements that opposed racist settler rule in the then Southern Rhodesia.
