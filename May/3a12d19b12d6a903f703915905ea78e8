Tobacco affected by nematodesBuhle Nkomo All tobacco growers are urged to destroy tobacco stalks on or before May 15 in adherence to the Plant Pests and Diseases Act [Chapter 19:08]. Stalks act as a host for diseases and pests like nematodes and spider mites hence destroying them starves the pests.Early and complete destruction of tobacco stalks is effective in reducing carryover of diseases and pests.Destruction of tobacco stalks can be carried out by first cutting the stems then ploughing or disking on the field as a way of pulling out roots out of the soil completely.After two weeks of the first operation, re-disking can be considered and one can plant a cover crop when root systems have dried out for rotation purposes as well as destruction of pests.Consequently, in a bid to ensure that there is no carryover of diseases, seedbeds are not to be established before stalks are destroyed.If tobacco stalks are not destroyed, associated diseases and pests will affect yield, quality as well as increase the farmers input cost.Tobacco growers who fail to destroy tobacco stalks on or before May 15 should be reported to the Department of Research and Specialist Services Plant Quarantine Services Institute (PQSI), AGRITEX, Tobacco Research Board (TRB) or Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB).Reports can be made to all PQSI offices or at TIMB regional offices located in Bindura, Mvurwi, Chinhoyi, Karoi, Marondera and Rusape.Tobacco leaf affected by spider mitesGrowers should also take note of the following legislative dates:Earliest date for sowing seed &#8211; June 1Earliest date for transplanting &#8211; September 1Last day of destroying all seedbeds &#8211; December 31Contravening the regulations requiring the destruction of tobacco plants or establishing seedbeds or transplanting tobacco outside the aforementioned stipulated dates, will result in a grower being subjected to the following penalties:For a first offence, a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for each hectare or part thereof in respect of which the offence is committed or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year or both fine and imprisonment.For a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for each hectare or part thereof in respect of which the offence is committed or imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both such fine and imprisonment.As tobacco growers continue to bring their produce to the market where farmers have so far been paid over $260 million, they are urged to consider their crop for forthcoming season through adhering to the aforementioned legislative dates for the destruction of tobacco stalks, establishing seedbeds, transplanting as well as ensuring that they do not lose out this season through nesting mischief.Two hundred cases of nesting have so far been recorded this season where offenders were made to pay fines at police stations and the nested bales were forfeited.Out of the 1 296 824 bales laid this season at both contract and auction floors, 252 bales were forfeited for nesting.Nesting is concealing trash or inferior tobacco underneath good quality tobacco.In conclusion, farmers are encouraged to adhere to legislative dates for tobacco production since they are there for a reason as well as to exercise diligence when baling their tobacco so as to avoid unnecessary inconveniences associated with nesting.For additional information contact TIMB on telephone numbers 08677004624/6 or 0772145166/9 or 0279-22082/21982 or 025-3439 or 067-24268/29246 or 0277-2700 or 064-7280 or 0271-6772 or Toll Free Numbers 08006003 / 0731999999 / 0712832804 or WhatsApp 0731999999 or E-mail: [email&#160;protected]
