Phillip ChiyangwaSports Reporter THREE of the continent s regional football blocs COSAFA, CECAFA and the North Zone yesterday signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding to work together for the development of the game in Africa. COSAFA president Philip Chiyangwa signed on behalf of his organisation in Manama, Bahrain, where he is attending the FIFA Congress.The deal could see better co-operation among the three blocs and there is even a possibility of club and national team competitions, between the regional groups, being organised in the future. It s a milestone agreement, said Chiyangwa. It shows that we are not content with the way things are, in as far as the state of our football is concerned, and we want to see more and as leaders we have to find ways of how to make that happen. You don t develop your football when you are living in an island, you need to work with others because it s all about competition, and we are happy that there is agreement here that we have to work together, in different sectors, to ensure that we serve our constituency. When I told you that this is now a moving train, that it won t stop any more until we get to where we want, in terms of excellence, a lot of people didn t believe me, but action speaks louder than words and all this is part of the grand vision to develop football.
