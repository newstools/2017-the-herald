I love you Rolf, as I love the warm sun, and that is what you are to my life, the sun about which everything else revolves for me, wrote the then pregnant woman to Christoffersen who was serving overseas in the Norwegian Navy, and added she was longing for her sweetheart to come home to Westfield. My time is up now, I must get back to work, but here s a warm, warm kiss for my sweet Norske and a prayer that you ll be home with me soon. Until death us do part, Virginia, she concluded. &#8211; Xinhua.
