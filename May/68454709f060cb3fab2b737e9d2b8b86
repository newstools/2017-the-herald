LONDON. Tony Adams has opened up about his alcoholic past, admitting that even when it seemed glamorous the reality was very different. The former England defender, who became Arsenal s most successful captain during his two decades at the club, gave up drinking in 1996 following a 12-year downward spiral that led to blackouts, prison and intensive care.He eventually sobered up before leading Arsenal to two more English Premier League and FA Cup doubles under Arsene Wenger, but the plight of contemporaries like Kenny Sansom and Paul Gascoigne have shown how different life could have been for Adams had he not altered his path.Writing in his new autobiography, Sober, which is being serialised in The Sun, Adams revealed it was after a four-day bender that he recognised the need for change.He wrote: On the Wednesday, I went to a restaurant and nightclub in Chelsea called Barbarella s and got smashed. I can t remember where I stayed. I do remember p****** and s****** in my pants, peeling them off and going out again. The Mirror.
