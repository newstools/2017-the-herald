LONDON. From racing his siblings round the backyard as a toddler to celebrating his sole World Championship crown with his tearful dad on the back of his bike, motorcycling and family were the inseparable constants in Nicky Hayden s life. Raised in a biking family in the same Kentucky town that was home to seven Nascar drivers and actor Johnny Depp, Hayden and his siblings would spend four hours a day riding on their own home circuit from the age of three. Practice made perfect. One of only six men to win the MotoGP title this century, Hayden provided the sport with one of its most memorable finales when he pipped Valentino Rossi to the 2006 crown.Hayden, who has died at the age of 35, five days after a collision with a car while cycling in Italy, never again got close to the championship but remained one of the sport s most popular riders.
