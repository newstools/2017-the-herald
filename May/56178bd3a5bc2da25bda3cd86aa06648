MELBOURNE. &#8211; Australia s cricketers union urged a swift resolution to a damaging pay dispute yesterday to avoid any strike disruption to this year s Ashes series. Cricket Australia last week threatened not to pay contracted players beyond the June 30 expiry of their current financial deal if they didn t accept a new offer. The robust statement prompted warnings of a strike, with pace spearhead Mitchell Starc tweeting: Makes for an interesting men s and women s ashes . . . Former Test all-rounder Shane Watson added his support by tweeting: Well said @mstarc56. It will be an interesting game of cricket without any players.
