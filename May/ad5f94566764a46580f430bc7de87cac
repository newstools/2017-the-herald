LONDON. Scorer of the goal that won Chelsea the title, Michy Batshuayi will hope to make his first English Premier League start for the club in tonight s home game with Watford. The Belgium striker came off the bench to score the decisive goal in Friday s 1-0 win at West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed Chelsea as champions.Batshuayi is yet to start a league game since arriving from Marseille last year, but could be given a run-out if, as expected, manager Antonio Conte elects to shuffle his pack. I m delighted for Michy, said centre-back Gary Cahill following victory at The Hawthorns.FixturesToday (9pm): Chelsea v WatfordTomorrow: Arsenal v Sunderland (8:45pm), Man City v West Brom (9pm)Wednesday (8:45pm): Southampton v Man UtdThursday (8:45pm): Leicester v Tottenham AFP
