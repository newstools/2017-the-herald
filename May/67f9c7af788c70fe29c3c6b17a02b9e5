There will be live entertainment on the night. We are still negotiating deals with some local artists but host of the event will be Zvidzai Mapfumo while disc jockey Selekta will be on the decks. Invited guests are expected to dress up for the occasion and the good thing is that the 25 selected designers will have a chance to choose the best dressed guest and share their story on designing and giving tips on dressing for the occasion, she said.
