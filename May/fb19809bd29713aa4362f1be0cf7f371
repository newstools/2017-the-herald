MILAN. &#8211; Ghana s Sulley Muntari dramatically walked off the pitch while playing for Pescara at Cagliari on Sunday after his complaints of racist abuse were met with a yellow card. The former AC Milan and Inter midfielder, who claimed the abuse also came from children, angrily confronted Cagliari fans, shouting at them: This is my colour. Muntari (32) could now face disciplinary measures after deciding to leave the field seconds before full-time &#8211; a decision that earned him a second yellow card, and then a red, from referee Daniele Minelli.Earlier, he had spoken directly with a section of the Cagliari supporters targeting him with racist abuse. They shouted at me from the beginning of the game, and in the first half I saw children in the group, so I went to their parents and gave them my jersey to set an example and to say you are not supposed to do that, he said. I tried to reason with them but the referee told me I had to stop. That s when I got pissed off. Why did he not stop the match? I am not a victim, but I am convinced that if they stopped the matches, this kind of thing would not happen any more. While leaving the pitch in frustration and murmuring Basta! (Enough) , Muntari went to address more supporters, showing them his arm and shouting: this is my colour, this is my colour. &#8211; AFP.
