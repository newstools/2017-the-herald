LONDON. Pep Guardiola has admitted he would have been sacked this season had he been at former clubs Barcelona or Bayern Munich. Guardiola has failed to win a trophy in his debut campaign with Manchester City, who are still not sure of clinching a Champions League spot.And Spaniard Guardiola conceded he must deliver trophies next season or face the prospect of being sacked for the first time in his glittering career. In my situation at a big club, I m sacked, said Guardiola. I m out. Sure, definitely. At the clubs I worked at before, I m not here. In six months, if you don t win, you re out, like at Barcelona or Bayern Munich. There you have to win by far. The Mirror.
