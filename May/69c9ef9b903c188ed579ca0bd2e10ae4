PALM BEACH. Golfer Tiger Woods was found asleep at the wheel with the engine running when he was arrested, US media reports say. The former world number one golfer was found at the wheel of his Mercedes, in the right lane, and had to be woken by a police officer early on Monday. Charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Mr Woods blamed an unexpected reaction to prescribed medication .He maintains that alcohol was not involved in the incident and tests didn t reveal any alcohol. Woods had extremely slow and slurred speech, a copy of the police report published by US outlets said. He was co-operative but confused .The results sheet from his breathalyser test noted he was unable to walk alone , but results showed he blew zeroes indicating a lack of alcohol in his breath.Mr Woods initially told the arresting officer he was coming back from Los Angeles, having been golfing, and said he did not know where he was. He then changed his story about where he was coming from and going to, the police report says.Officers also recorded that Mr Woods had failed all but one of the roadside tests including standing on one leg and the walk and turn test.The police document also revealed some of the golfer s medical details, including a history of multiple knee and Achilles tendon surgeries. I understand the severity of what I did and I take full responsibility for my actions, Mr Woods said in a statement earlier. I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved. What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn t realise the mix of medications had affected me so strongly. Police records show the 41-year-old golfer was pulled over at about 03:00 local time (07:00 GMT) near his home in Jupiter and later taken into custody. He was released from Palm Beach County jail at 10:30 local time.Mr Woods is due in court for a mandatory appearance in early July. BBC Sport.
