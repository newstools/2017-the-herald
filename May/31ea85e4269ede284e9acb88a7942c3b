Sports Reporter THE International Federation of Karate Zimbabwe recently appointed Philemon Mangena as the organisation s president in a move expected to improve their administration. The Premier Tobacco Auction Floors managing director will be responsible for the organisation s administration. IFK branch chief, Tawanda Mufundisi, said they are seeking to improve the way they operate and bringing Mangena will add value. From what we had, we found it difficult in terms of administration. He (Mangena) is going to assist on that. Over the years we tried to do it ourselves, to be administrators and instructors at the same time, but we realised it s taking us back. So we saw it wise to bring in someone with administrative experience. He is a businessman and he will choose a board that will help him, said Mufundisi.The full contact style has some of their fighters in the national team to take part in the AFCKO tournament on May 27 in South Africa.They also want to send five of their members for the Fifth IFK World Tournament in Romania on May 27 and 28. Mangena said his involvement with IFK is mainly to help the style grow. Karate is my passion because of my background, where I grew up. These guys that I am working with, Mufundisi and all the guys, we all grew up in the same neighbourhood . . . It appears they are not getting recognition. So what I want to try and do is to put it up there. I am a chartered accountant by profession and the current managing director of Premier Tobacco Auction Floors. I believe administration is administration and I think that s what these guys lack and I want to come in and help them. Look they are good at what they do, but I just need to help them get to a level where they are supposed to be, Mangena said.
