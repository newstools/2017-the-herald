Cde ChadzamiraGeorge Maponga Masvingo Bureau War veterans here have hailed the election of Masvingo West National Assembly member Cde Ezra Chadzamira as the new Zanu-PF provincial chairman. They said his crushing victory was the tonic needed to spur the ruling party to victory in next year s harmonised elections.Ex-combatants in the province had openly supported Cde Chadzamira in the run-up to last Saturday s poll rerun.Cde Chadzamira beat Retired Colonel Mutero Masanganise in the poll rerun presided over by Politburo member Cde Cain Mathema.He polled 29 543 votes compared to Rtd Col Masanganise s 1 080. The election was thrown into disarray after Rtd Col Masanganise announced that he was withdrawing his candidature days before the poll.He wrote to Zanu-PF secretary for Administration Dr Ignatius Chombo last week citing a number of irregularities.Rtd Col Masanganise dismissed Cde Chadzamira s victory, saying the contest failed to meet the minimum standards of a credible poll.But Masvingo war veterans provincial chairman Cde Tendeukai Chinooneka said ex-freedom fighters in the province were happy that President Mugabe had allowed Zanu-PF members in the province to choose a leader of their choice.He said the election of Cde Chadzamira as Zanu-PF Masvingo chair showed that the ruling party was democratic. The people of Masvingo spoke and they did it loudly, which is a sign of democracy at work in Zanu-PF, said Cde Chinooneka. We were elated with Cde Chadzamira s victory because it reflects the will of the people and we can safely say to President Mugabe that as far as Zanu-PF is concerned in Masvingo, he can sleep nicely because we will deliver the province in next year s elections. Cde Chinooneka said the ruling party was on course to retain all the 26 National Assembly seats in the province like it did in 2013. Cde Chadzamira s victory will galvanise all ruling party structures to work towards making sure that Zanu-PF bags all the 26 parliamentary seats in next year s elections, he said. His victory has unified and strengthened the party in the province.
