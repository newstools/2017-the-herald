Arsene WengerLONDON. Arsene Wenger insists Arsenal will give everything to finish in the top four, but insists the future of his key players is not dependent on securing Champions League football for next season. Earlier this week, Alexis Sanchez told Sky Sports that he will decide his Arsenal future in the summer, while Mesut Ozil s contract expires at the end of next season.Victory over Manchester United on Sunday gave Arsenal fresh hope of a top-four finish for the 21st consecutive season, and Wenger says that will be their sole focus at Southampton tonight. We build our success with intelligence, said Wenger. We took advantage of the chances we created in the right moments of the game. We responded after last Sunday and it gives us still a chance to go in the top four. For us we just want to win our games to have a chance. That s all we can do. Asked whether the lack of Champions League football would impact on the club, Wenger said: Maybe, it can impact if in a longer spell you are not in there. Sky Sports
