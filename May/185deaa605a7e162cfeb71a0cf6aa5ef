STUTTGART. Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova lost in the semi-finals in Stuttgart on Saturday, her controversial comeback from a 15-month doping ban ending in defeat to one of her biggest critics. Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam winner and former world number one, lost 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 to Kristina Mladenovic as the Russian exited her first tournament back from a ban after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open. I m not angry, I d have loved to have used the opportunity when I was ahead in the second set, so I had a bit of a let down which allowed her to get back in the match, gain confidence and play well, said Sharapova.Mladenovic has been a vocal critic of Sharapova s return to tennis and on the eve of their semi accused her of getting extra help , having been handed wild cards to play at the Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome tournaments.
