LONDON. &#8211; Anthony Joshua could defend his world heavyweight boxing titles in the United States within the next couple of fights , says Showtime boss Stephen Espinoza. The unbeaten 27-year-old has enhanced his reputation as one of the biggest stars in British sport after his epic victory over Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley stadium on Saturday night.Joshua will take time to consider his next fight, which could be a mandatory defence of either the IBF or WBA super titles, or a rematch with Klitschko.And Espinoza is eager for AJ to showcase his punching power to the American public after he signed a multi-fight deal with the TV network last year. In our discussions with both (promoter) Eddie Hearn and Anthony, coming to America is definitely a priority, Espinoza exclusively told Sky Sports. I believe he is going to take a little bit of time off after this fight. Whether there is a rematch or not, remains to be seen, but I know that having a fight in the US, in the next couple of fights, is definitely a priority. American Deontay Wilder watched Joshua s dramatic stoppage win from ringside, as part of the Sky Sports Box Office team, and Espinoza hopes to build a unification clash between the two big-punching world champions. Ultimately from the US perspective, the ultimate destination would seem to be &#8211; at some point in the next year hopefully Joshua versus Wilder, said Espinoza, who has worked with the likes of Floyd Mayweather. The question really would be when to do it? When would be an appropriate time to let it build and to allow the marketing and visibility of the fight to continue to build? &#8211; Sky Sports.
