Makomborero Mutimukulu in SANDTON, South Africa THE second edition of the Arnold Classic Africa, the continent s blue ribbon bodybuilding and fitness competition comes to life here today, with Zimbabwe once again a victim of talent poaching . Two of the leading Zimbabwean bodybuilders Crofton Murombo and Regina Jonga will be conspicuous by their absence when it all goes down at the Sandton Convention Centre. The duo appears to be taking an all-too-familiar path.Over the years, the country has lost some of its finest sportsmen, Tonderai Chavhanga and Tendai Mtawarira, among the high-profile of the lot, to the Rainbow Nation and the same fate appears to be befalling us again in bodybuilding.Jonga got a kiss of life after an impressive outing at last year s debut event and has made serious progress over the last 12 months as she benefits from working out in a well-equipped gym as well as a constant supply of supplements.Her success on the bodybuilding scene here could not be missed by anyone, even if they had tried to.But there was always a fear that the South Africans would offer her much more than just a gym and supplements.That fear was not misplaced.Apparently a chance to compete under the South African flag has been waved right in front of Jonga s face. It s a life-changing offer and it will be tough for Jonga to say no.While Jonga s next move is subject to speculation as she is refusing to answer questions about it, Murombo s move in the coming days is an open secret.He has been selected to represent Team South Africa on the international stage at the prestigious at the PCA Bodypower UK.
