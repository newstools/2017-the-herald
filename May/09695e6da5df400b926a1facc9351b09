BARCELONA. Barcelona fans have many more years to enjoy Lionel Messi, assured outgoing coach Luis Enrique after the Argentine handed his boss a successful send-off in a 3-1 Copa del Rey final win over Alaves. Messi opened the scoring and helped set up goals for Neymar and Paco Alcacer just before halftime as Alaves slumped to defeat in their first Spanish Cup final despite Theo Hernandez s stunning free-kick to level at 1-1. He is extraordinary, an extraterrestrial, Enrique said of Messi after he lifted his 30th trophy at Barca a month ahead of his 30th birthday. To be the No 1 you don t just have to be the chosen one in all the technical aspects of the game, but you have to be very strong physically. Leo Messi is a very strong player, he takes care of himself as much as he can. He has a change of pace which he will maintain. Messi will be around for a while to come. Victory saw Enrique seal a ninth title of a largely successful three-year spell in charge despite missing out on La Liga and the Champions League this season. AFP
