The Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe yesterday expressed optimism that revenue from trophy hunting would improve from $70 million last year to $100 million this year, buoyed by the favourable outcome of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) held in 2016. Last year was dominated by debate over the need to impose stricter controls on the hunting of certain animals, particularly elephants and lions in order to stop their depletion.Some countries proposed to add elephants in Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) appendix 1 listing where most African elephants enjoy the highest level of international legal protection, but the proposals were defeated at a Cites meeting held in South Africa late last year.Emmanuel Fundira, president of the association told New Ziana that hopes are high that revenue would increase during the on-going trophy hunting season.Mr Fundira said as a result, the sector lost about 30 percent in hunting trophy revenue earnings. Last year, revenue from animal trophy hunting was $70 million. &#8211; New Ziana.
