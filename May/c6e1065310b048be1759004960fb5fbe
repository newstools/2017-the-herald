LONDON. David Miller has described his heroics in the nailbiting two-run loss to England in the second one-day international (ODI) at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton on Saturday as bittersweet. Miller hammered 71 off 51 balls to take the Proteas within sight of a challenging chase, but lamented the failure to take the team across the line after putting in the hard work to get so close to the winning target.Victory would have made Miller s innings one of the most impactful of his 95-match ODI career, but the 27-year-old takes valuable confidence ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy starting this week. It was disappointing not to go over the line at the end, Miller said on Sunday. Scoring 71 gives me a lot of confidence going forward. I have been feeling good over the last couple of months, I didn t get too many games in the IPL but I still felt good working hard on my game in the nets. Miller says the success of the 62-run sixth-wicket partnership with Chris Morris (35 off 22 balls) was the ability to assess the situation and to take constructive risks.Both big-hitters timed their chase to perfection until the last over, and will use the missed opportunity as a learning experience for future reference. The proof is in the pudding, which is in trying to win games for your country, he said. We fell short which is disappointing, but we are also preparing for something big. &#8211; SuperSport&nbsp;
