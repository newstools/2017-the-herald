Our performance was not good today, we played better football against Bulawayo City and today we were looking at collecting maximum points but sometimes we might have a bad start with a happy ending, he said.His opposite number Stanford Stix M tizwa said they needed maximum points. We needed maximum points after we drew at home last week, it s like two points lost rather than a point gained because we came here looking for maximum points at all cost, he said. TeamsTriangle: R.
