MADRID. Manchester United will be encouraged to make a summer move for Gareth Bale if he begins the Champions League final on the bench, according to reports in Spain. Real Madrid forward Bale has been a long-term target for United, who wanted to sign him before his world-record move from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 and have been linked with him since.Bale has been a star for Real since, but has suffered injury problems this season with Isco putting in brilliant displays as his replacement.According to Barcelona-based website Mundo Deportivo, Isco s form could see him start in Saturday s final ahead of Bale, which could give United belief they would be able to tempt the Welshman back to the Premier League.Being benched would be a double blow for Bale, as the Champions League final is this year being played in Wales, at Cardiff s Principality Stadium.Mundo report that Bale would feel betrayed if he was not started in the final, which could pave the way for a sensational return to English football.Jose Mourinho is looking to revamp his squad in preparation for Champions League football next year, and has already reportedly made a bid for Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic. Antoine Griezmann and Romelu Lukaku are other names in the frame.They have also been connected with another Real Madrid star, James Rodriguez, who looks certain to depart the Bernabeu after a lack of first-team opportunities.Bale however, would represent a real step up, although he does have a good chance of playing in Cardiff after training on Saturday without any trace of injury issues.According to Mundo, he has met with Real manager Zinedine Zidane and says he is ready to play a full part against Juventus.
