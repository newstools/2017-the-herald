Mark 11 vs 22; So Jesus answered and said to them, Have faith in God. For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea,and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Belief is probably one of the most difficult disciplines to master. It takes a lot of conviction to have confidence in the knowledge that whatever you believe can be done is possible and it will be done well.Many people fail to reach their potential just because they are held back by a voice that continuously puts doubt, confusion and uncertainty in their minds.Our Lord is a God of order, this can be seen in the way He created everything to have a beginning and an end, like how the sun rises and sets everyday.Therefore you should allow His voice that lies within you to guide you, lead you and more importantly, affirm you.Where there is confusion you should pray for clarity and allow you mind, heart and ears to be attuned to His voice.As you begin to listen to the inner voice, it will help you to rise above the doubt to a point where you believe you can do anything and if God is with you, then you know you are unstoppable.You will overcome the numerous obstacles and hurdles that you face because ultimately these experiences are meant to sharpen your faith and affirm His power.Rise beyond the doubt and start believing. You will see Him do the impossible.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on [email&#160;protected]; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
