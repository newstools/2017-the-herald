MADRID. &#8211; Novak Djokovic moved into the semi-finals of the Madrid Masters tennis tournament yesterday without hitting a ball as Kei Nishikori withdrew with a wrist injury, tournament organisers said. The world number eight missed the Barcelona Open late last month due to the recurring problem.Nishikori is now also a major doubt for the Rome Masters next week with 10 days to go until the start of the French Open. I will plan to play Rome, but we ll see, said the Japanese. I cannot promise to play or pull out right now. (The) French is more important. Djokovic will either renew his rivalry with Rafael Nadal or face Belgium s David Goffin in the last four today.On the other side of the draw Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas advanced to his first ever Masters series semi-final by outlasting German wonder kid Alexander Zverev 3-6, 6-0, 6-4.Zverev had been on a seven-match victory streak after winning his second title of the season in Munich last week. &#8211; AFP.
