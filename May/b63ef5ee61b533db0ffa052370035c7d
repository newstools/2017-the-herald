From George Maponga in Masvingo War veterans here have thrown their weight behind Masvingo West National Assembly member Cde Ezra Chadzamira in his quest to become the ruling party chairman for the province ahead of tomorrow s elections. Cde Chadzamira once served as zanu-pf chairman for Masvingo before he was suspended by National Political Commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere together with two other ruling party provincial chairmen for alleged insolence.He will square up with war veteran Retired Colonel Mutero Masanganise in a weekend poll re-run after the first election between the pair held at the end of February was inconclusive.During the February poll, voting only took place in 64 percent of the 408 party districts that were supposed to vote with polling failing to take place in some areas owing to a number of factors including bad weather.The zanu-pf Politburo ordered a re-run after provisional results released by Politburo member Cde Jorum Gumbo saw Cde Chadzamira leading by 12 393 votes against Retired Colonel Masanganise s 4 888 votes.Masvingo provincial war veterans chairman Cde Tendeukai Chinooneka yesterday said former freedom fighters in Masvingo had met and agreed to back Cde Chadzamira. War veterans leaders from all the four corners of the province met at Victoria High School on Wednesday where they agreed to throw their lot behind Cde Chadzamira. We met as war veterans leaders drawn from all districts in Masvingo and resolved to back Cde Chadzamira in Saturday s elections to choose the zanu-pf chair. As war veterans we are guided by what people want and we are the fish that survives in water which is the people so we stand guided by what they want and in this case they want Cde Chadzamira so he is the one we are backing, he said.Cde Chinooneka pointed out that the former freedom fighters in Masvingo also noted that Cde Chadzamira was clearly the people s choice as evidenced by the number of votes he amassed in the first election in February.He said besides resolving to back Cde Chadzamira, war veterans in Masvingo also re-affirmed their loyalty to President Mugabe who is the Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. The war veterans in Masvingo unanimously pledged their unwavering support and backing to President Mugabe as zanu-pf gears for the 2018 elections. We made it very clear that we are fully behind the President and we will not back down in supporting him because of his visionary leadership dating back to the pre-independence era, said Cde Chinooneka.Masvingo war veterans also agreed to push for the ex-freedom fighters to be considered in irrigation projects to be initiated after the commissioning of Tokwe-Mukosi dam.The backing of Cde Chadzamira by war veterans in Masvingo makes him a firm favourite to romp to victory in the elections.The polls will be superintended by Cde Gumbo and his Politburo counterpart Cde Cain Mathema.
