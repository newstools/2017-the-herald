Noah Pito in Magunje Magunje Growth Point turned into a Danger Zone over the weekend when Freeman took to the stage to perform before a crowd of about 10 000 people during the Hurungwe District HIV Music Gala held at Magunje Stadium. Blessing Shumba and comedian-cum-musician Kapfupi also graced the festival that started at 10 am with curtain-raising performance from local Karoi group, Tasvika Challengers.Both Kapfupi and Blessing Shumba thrilled fans with their polished performances. Kapfupi s wife &#8211; Mai Ngaa &#8211; and pint sized Majisa also did their best to keep the crowd s morale high.Volleys of jokes from the comedian-cum-musician after every song also did a lot to keep the crowd in stitches as kids and mothers jostled to draw closer to the stage.Blessing Shumba who took up his slot after Kapfupi managed to capture the crowd with his prayer and preaching moments that propelled even non-believers to jostle their way closer to the musician for deliverance.All hell broke loose when youthful Freeman appeared on stage around 3 pm with his danger zone! trademark shout.The stadium reverberated with Danger Zone! as both young and old gave the musician a thunderous welcome.It was all skipping into the air and waving as the Danger Zone king sang before his fans in Magunje for the first time. One up-coming chanter, Marlon Manyepa (DJ Criminal) of Magunje had the opportunity to play Shinso in one of Freeman s popular songs (Ndinoshanda semukono).He was later given an opportunity to sing his own composition which saw many youths in the crowd wanting to come on stage and showcase their musical talents inspired by Freeman.Leaving the venue after his slot was not an easy task ,for the fans temporally took the Joyina City hit maker hostage blocking his car from leaving for almost 25 minutes as they entreated with the Danger Zone king to come back and perform.The car only managed to leave after security officers managed to open the way by shoving away fans some of whom wanted to be taken photos with their iconic chanter. It was the first time for freeman to perform at Magunje Growth Point. Later that night Freeman held a successful show with Killer T in Karoi.Hurungwe District medical officer Dr Annmore Mutisi was the guest of honour at the gala organised by National AIDS Council of Zimbabwe in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Child Care.The gala ran under the theme Closing the tap of new HIV infections .During the occasion fans had access to HIV testing and cervical cancer screening among other health services.
