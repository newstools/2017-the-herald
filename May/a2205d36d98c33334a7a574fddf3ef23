Bongani with the late mother Brenda FassieBrenda Fassie s son Bongani Fassie, who this week publicly bragged he was rich after inheriting his mother s R20 million estate, is facing eviction from his Johannesburg apartment for failing to pay rent for almost three months. Bongani, a hip-hop artist who was also part of revered hip-hop ensemble Jozi, has been given an ultimatum by his landlord Landsford Livas Japhet to settle his arrears by the end of this month or be evicted. Fassie is allegedly over R34 000 in arrears after failing to pay his R1 300 rent per night at Japhet s apartment, which he turned into a motel. Japhet confirmed Bongani defaulted on his rent, but declined to comment further. This is the business between me and Bongani, so I can t comment on it, he said.Bongani refuted he has defaulted on his rent payments. It is the wrong Bongani situation you are talking about man. I thought you were calling me about the song that I m doing with Busi, but I can t really comment on the matter you are talking about, he said.News that Bongani was struggling to make ends meet was leaked by a record company official whom Japhet begged to bail the singer out.
