However he settled on TaylorMade after deciding the firm s clubs and ball offered the best chance to regain his world number one ranking. My future rests firmly in my hands that s why I choose TaylorMade. I ve been around the game long enough and have tested most clubs on the market, but I have never been as excited about equipment as I am right now, McIlroy said in a statement. AFP.
