Philippians 4 vs 13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. We all have people that we admire, people who have done extremely well by all measures and we live our lives under their shadows.When we benchmark ourselves against these people, we always come short and we think that we may never ever be like them. Their achievements remain a distant glimmer of where we would like to be.God has placed these people in our lives to not only motivate us but for us to emulate them. Human nature constantly tells us how great they are but we often forget the fact that through His grace, we can surpass their achievements and do even better than they have.Elisha prayed that he would be able to do more than his mentor Elijah ever did. Sure enough, after the departure of the prophet he picked up his rod and cloak and blazed a phenomenal trail of faith and achievement.Do you think that you can not achieve greatness? Do you feel that those who have gone ahead of you can not be matched? Say a prayer today and ask God to give you the ability to do beyond what you have ever imagined.Through His grace and power you will surpass even your wildest imagination and you will be the envy and inspiration of others.Be blessed!REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For More Info:Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.orgEmail us on [email&#160;protected]Catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.&nbsp;
