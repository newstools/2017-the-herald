Cape Town. &#8211; A suspected drug runner made a literal leap of faith &#8211; over a wall and using a trampoline &#8211; to evade approaching Metro Police officers on Friday night. JP Smith, the city s mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services, yesterday told News24 that as officers neared the trampoline, they heard a boing sound as the suspect disappeared over the wall.The bouncer then managed to flee. Smith jokingly said officers had thought about whether or not to impound the trampoline which aided and abetted in the suspect s escape. But they decided against it.The incident happened during raids and search warrants executed in areas including Leonsdale, Lavender Hill, Hanover Park and Parow. During the operation officers found tik lollies, mandrax tablets and dagga which had been abandoned.Smith said there was a suspected drug selling operation at the premises where the trampoline was located. While no drugs were found there, he said drug paraphernalia was discovered.This included little packets. Smith said when officers had run around the house, they had heard the boing . They had tried to see where the suspect landed. We ran around to the back to try and block him. However, Smith said the suspect may have been hiding in another yard. Smith said at the premises from which the suspect had jumped, a section comprised of a window with a slot.Behind that was a car seat, removed from a vehicle, in which an alleged drug dealer was seated. The alleged dealer told officers he was giving driving lessons.However, it was believed this was the seat from which drug transactions were handled. Smith said it was not clear if the trampoline was used just for evading authorities.Metro Police officers at the scene had tested its bounce-worthiness before moving on to another scene. &#8211; News24
