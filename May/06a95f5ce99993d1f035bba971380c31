The recent hysteria about beheading operation and pre-emptive attack , openly staged by the US imperialists and the South Korean puppet military warmongers at the doorstep of the DPRK, is just the tip of the iceberg of those moves. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the US and the Intelligence Service (IS) of South Korea, hotbed of evils in the world, hatched a vicious plot to hurt the supreme leadership of the DPRK and those acts have been put into the extremely serious phase of implementation after crossing the threshold of the DPRK.A hideous terrorist group, which the CIA and the IS infiltrated into the DPRK on the basis of covert and meticulous preparations to commit state-sponsored terrorism against the supreme leadership of the DPRK by use of bio-chemical substance, has been recently detected.The murderous demons of the IS who conspired with the CIA ideologically corrupted and bribed a DPRK citizen surnamed Kim, the then worker of the timber industrial branch in the Khabarovsk Territory of Russia in June 2014, and turned him into a terrorist full of repugnance and revenge against the supreme leadership of the DPRK.Bio-chemical substance can be added in cooperation with the CIA if one single correct information is obtained, the component of terrorism-purposed bio-chemical substance is the know-how of the CIA and it is only the CIA that can produce such substance, and that hardware, supplies and funds needed for committing terrorism against the supreme leadership will completely be borne by the IS.The DPRK Ministry of State Security clarifies as follows upon authorisation since the hysteria of the US and the South Korean puppet intelligence institution aimed to hurt the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership has reached the dangerous phase which can no longer be overlooked:1. We will ferret out and mercilessly destroy to the last one the terrorists of the US CIA and the puppet IS of South Korea targeting the dignity of the DPRK supreme leadership.We do not view the recent hideous crime just as an act of encroachment on the security and sovereignty of the state that can be committed by dishonest hostile forces.2. Korean-style anti-terrorist attack will be commenced from this moment to sweep away the intelligence and plot-breeding organisations of the US imperialists and the puppet clique, the most mean and brutal hideous terrorist group in the world.Even though we wipe out all those villains involved in the recent hideous state-sponsored terrorism, there is no vouch that the enemies would stop manoeuvring as long as the chieftains and the plot-breeding bases remain.3. All the countries and peoples of the world that value justice and peace should resolutely turn out in the sacred struggle to terminate the heinous terrorist act committed by the U.S., kingpin of terrorism and chieftain of plot, and the south Korean puppet group of traitors.The present international situation proves that terrorism is a common enemy to humankind and the world would have no moment of peace unless terrorism is eradicated.The US State-sponsored terrorism against the DPRK is being carried out in an indiscriminate and dangerous way.Recently, there disclosed part of terrorist crimes which the US CIA and the puppet Intelligent Service of South Korea have pushed forward in secrecy for the purpose of committing state-sponsored terrorism against the supreme leadership of the DPRK by bio-chemical substance.The international community is stunned at the fact that the US, so loudly calling for war against terrorism , manipulated the hideous state-sponsored political terrorism directly related to the dignity of the supreme leadership of the sovereign state. The moves to stifle the DPRK getting daily reckless by the US and the puppet group of traitors are focused on the supreme leadership of the DPRK. As known, the largest-ever Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills held across South Korea that lasted more than 60 days were ones for an actual war targeting the removal of leadership of the DPRK and overturn of its social system. In the special operation drill by use of special warfare troops and means, the US conducted combined beheading operation for getting versed in assassination methods and destruction of key facilities together with surprise precision strike drills targeting removal of the leadership of the DPRK with the involvement of air strike means like B-1B nuclear strategic bomber, F-22 Raptor and F-35B Stealth fighters.The US marines and the Striker brigade of the ground force, and large landing ships of the US navy carried out a drill for surprise advance into Pyongyang .The terrorist acts carried out within the boundary of Korea by the US special units were reflected in the action plan of the US Defence Department revealed several years ago.The US amassed personnel in the vicinity of the border of the DPRK, set afloat rumours at home and abroad and fomented chaos to create conflict .This article was written by the Ministry of State Security of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea.Every year it funds anti-DPRK plot-breeding organisations after earmarking special appropriations in the state budget, escalating psychological warfare and destabilising operations against the DPRK in a phased way.By origin the US is a terrorist State. The Disarmament and Peace Institute of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK recently released a study report disclosing the danger of the heinous moves the US has persisted while resorting to military adventure to push the situation on the Korean peninsula to the point of explosion of a thermonuclear war, and clarifying the validity of the principled stand of the DPRK to firmly defend the peace and stability on the peninsula and in the region.The US military provocation moves have reached the height with the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 joint military drills as occasions, the report said, and went on:The US hurled 300 000-strong troops into the aggression war drills, including troops from the US military bases in areas around the Korean peninsula and even its mainland, to say nothing of those troops present in South Korea and the South Korean puppet forces.Through the joint military drill the US posed an open military threat to the DPRK and, in actuality, planned to put preemptive attack and aggression war into practice.Under the active patronage and instigation of the US, the South Korean puppet forces conducted provocation in the hotspot waters in the West Sea of Korea in real earnest to ignite a war.Due to the US extreme military provocation moves, the acute situation on the peninsula has lasted even after the joint military drills.Timed to coincide with the end of the drills, the US introduced Carl Vinson carrier task force, Michigan nuclear submarine and other strategic assets into the Korean peninsula, ratcheting up military tension to the maximum.On May 1, just one day after joint military drills came to an end, B-1B nuclear strategic bomber formation was brought into the sky over South Korea to hold the drill of dropping nuclear bombs.From May 3, the US staged joint military drills in areas around the Korean peninsula together with Japan, Britain and France, rendering tenser the situation on the peninsula, over which dark clouds of a nuclear war hang heavily.The evil cycle of escalation of tension has continued on the Korean peninsula due to the aggression war moves steadily conducted by the US in conspiracy with its vassal forces.This article was written by the Ministry of State Security of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea
