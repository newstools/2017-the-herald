Sports Reporter HARARE City finally got off the mark when they won away at Tsholotsho at the weekend and coach Mike Madzivanyika says this was long overdue. The Sunshine Boys needed six games to register their first win of the season. We have been playing well since the start of the season, but somehow it could not happen. We lost some matches that I feel we shouldn t have lost. The biggest challenge was that we were not scoring enough, but we are working on that. I am sure this win will help build confidence going forward. We still need to keep working hard because the journey is long. It s still a long way to go and I m sure the boys will continue to aim high, said Madzivanyika.Ngezi Platinum returned to the top of the table with a 1-0 win over Shabanie Mine at Baobab on Saturday.They dislodged giants Highlanders who featured in a goalless draw at Chapungu.How Mine and ZPC Kariba were the biggest movers after they continued with their winning ways.League action will continue this weekend with the blockbuster clash between Highlanders and Dynamos at Barbourfields being the highlight.PSL have also rescheduled the Week Three fixtures that were disturbed by the Independence Cup tournament to the middle of next week in their quest to clear the backlog.FixturesSaturday: How Mine v FC Platinum (Barbourfields, 1pm), Bulawayo City v Black Rhinos (Barbourfields, 3pm), ZPC Kariba v Tsholotsho (Nyamhunga), Yadah v Chicken Inn (NSS),Sunday: Hwange v Triangle United (Colliery), Shabanie Mine v Chapungu (Maglas), Harare City v Ngezi Platinum (Morris Depot), Highlanders v Dynamos (Barbourfields),Postponed: CAPS United v Bantu RoversRescheduled Match Day Three fixturesWednesday 17th May: Harare City v Highlanders (NSS), Chicken Inn v FC Platinum (Luveve),Thursday 18th May: Dynamos v Black Rhinos (NSS), ZPC Kariba v CAPS United (Nyamhunga)
