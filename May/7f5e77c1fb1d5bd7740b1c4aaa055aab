Mesut OzilLONDON. Mesut Ozil insists he has given his all for Arsenal this season and does not value the opinion of his critics. Former Gunners defender Martin Keown accused the club s record signing of giving up on his teammates following his display against Tottenham last month, while Sky Sports Jamie Redknapp described him as a passenger in that game.But the Germany international has denied those suggestions, insisting criticism motivates him and he only values Arsene Wenger s verdict on his performances. The expectations are always high, which I guess is normally a positive, you could say, Ozil told Sky Sports News. But I know what I can do and it doesn t affect me really. I ve played for Real Madrid, I ve played for Germany and I ve had praise and criticism throughout my career and it s only made me stronger. For me what s most important, as I ve always said, is the manager s opinion because when it comes from him you know it s the truth, be it positive or be it negative. Sky Sports.&nbsp;
