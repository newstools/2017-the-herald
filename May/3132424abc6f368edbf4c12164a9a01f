Antonio ConteLONDON. &#8211; Chelsea manager Antonio Conte does not believe tonight s meeting with Arsenal in the FA Cup final will be Arsene Wenger s last game as manager of the north London club. Wenger is yet to extend his contract with Arsenal, which runs out at the end of the season, and has come under fire from fans after failing to secure Champions League qualification for the first time in 20 years.But Conte believes it is unfair to suggest Wenger s time at the Emirates Stadium will soon be up and says the achievements of the Frenchman s 21-year Arsenal tenure should not be overlooked. I know very well Arsenal s history in the FA Cup and also with Arsene, Conte said of Wenger, who is bidding to win a record seventh FA Cup. They won a lot of trophies in this tournament. I never won this trophy and I think for this reason, tomorrow could be a good possibility for me and my team to lift the trophy. For sure I don t trust that tomorrow will be the last game for Arsene. I think he deserves to work with Arsenal. Because he showed in this 20 years to be a great manager. He did a good job and only this season they missed the Champions League. In England, this target, sometimes you can undervalue this. But Arsenal played for 19 years in a row in this competition. I think this shows his work was very good. He won titles with his team. But we have to play great attention (due to the uncertainty) in modern football. &#8211; SuperSport.
