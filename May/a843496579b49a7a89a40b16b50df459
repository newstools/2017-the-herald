Express Fashions director director Paul Shambare known as Elder Shambare said they were happy with the response to the riddim. This is a milestone to our campaign of taking Zimdancehall artistes out there. It was produced by Gangster Express Studios and we are working with musicians based in Victoria Falls. It features more than 20 artistes from this side. We want to promote Victoria Falls youths in Zimdancehall and to promote Express Wear which is our own fashion label, he said.He said they will be having a number of commercial riddims from that the tourist town, best known for the majestic falls that bear the same name. We have our own Briz Sox, who is equally good but due to lack of exposure they are failing to make it. We will be taking them to Harare for shows so that they take it far, he said.Shambare, who successfully hosted Kinnah s birthday bash recently said they will also be launching their Express Wear on the same day. Our fashion label will be launched on the same day we launch the riddim. We are hoping for the best, he said.He has worked with several dancehall musicians that include Killer T, Soul Jah Love, Winky D, Kinna, Tocky and Lady Squanda among others. Our main focus has been dancehall, but now we are spreading wings to all genres. And we will be having these functions in different parts of the country, he added.
