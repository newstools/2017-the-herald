MADRID. Rafael Nadal s flawless record on clay this season continued as he out-gunned the impressive Dominic Thiem to win the Madrid Masters tennis title for a fifth time 7-6 (10/8), 6-4 on Sunday night. The Spaniard is now 15-0 on his favoured surface this year having also picked up his 10th titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona in recent weeks.And the 14-time Grand Slam champion is now strong favourite to add a 10th French Open crown next month as he romped to victory on home soil for the loss of just one set all week.Victory also moves Nadal above Roger Federer to fourth in the world rankings. I am aware that if I am fit and I can play well, I have the capacity to win important titles and achieve my goals, said Nadal.Thiem also fell victim to Nadal s supreme form in the final in Barcelona two weeks ago, but there was little for the 23-year-old to be dispirited about as he pushed Nadal all the way in his first Masters series final. Sometimes against the best players in the world, the best ever player on this surface, you even lose when you play well, said Thiem, who also rises to a career high seventh in the rankings. Now that I did it once, playing really well in such a big tournament, the next step is to maintain this level next week. AFP.
