Business Reporter MOBILE Network operator, NetOne has invaded the internet services provider space through two newly launched products, One-Fi and One-Cliq which introduce the company s adoption of convergence in line with latest global trends. Under that strategy, NetOne is evolving from being a traditional network operator, moving from a basic voice, data and SMS which has been what the MNO has been associated with in the past.Acting chief executive officer Brian Mutandiro said NetOne s angle of innovation is based on Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) and launch of One-Fi and One-Cliq announces the company s arrival on the convergence scene through platforms which provide fibre like broadband services complimented by mobility. As NetOne, we have shifted from being a mobile service provider to a communication service provider with the capability to offer voice, video, internet, mobility, IPTV and a host of other applications which can now be supported via a NetOne line. Our value addition innovations are also in line with Government s thrust on the provision of services that enhance e-commerce, e- health, e-agriculture and e- learning and our strategies are deliberately biased towards inclusive connectivity in Zimbabwe hence One-Fi will be a vital enabler in the community information centres in both rural and urban communities, said Mr Mutandiro.One-FI is a Wire to the X (WTTX) service, where X may represent businesses, churches, homes, universities, schools, shopping malls, hotels and any other public places.One-Fi, which can connect up to 32 people at the same location using a NetOne sim card, becomes a One Stop Shop for all communication requirements. Subscribers can now have bundled services from one operator.Mr Mutandiro said One-Fi is a response to feedback from customers who had been inconvenienced by being customers of NetOne during the day and shift to other service providers at night because we did not meet their fibre requirements hence this new dispensation .The One-Fi Solution is packaged with a one-time purchase of a home wi-fi device that costs $130. Following the purchase of the device, subscribers will be able to access the One-Fi data bundles at prices from as low as $9, to $99.The second product launched yesterday, One-Cliq applies to closed user groups both formal and informal and is premised on the desire to enable ease of communication by offering discounted rates to community groups such as business groups, church cell groups, sporting groups, that is, fan clubs, educational or professional groups, mukando and any other like-minded groups. All you need is to have a minimum of five people in your group and you sign up using NetOne SIM cards and you are entitled to special rates so that everyone in your group has access to affordable technology. With the advent of technology, we cannot underestimate the importance of social media and we are cognisant of the fact that most groups are found on WhatsApp and Facebook hence our product is not biased towards formal groups only but it cuts across all for instance we are saying you belong to a WhatsApp group be family, school, work, church, boozers, dancing or whatever it may be as long as you are more than five you all qualify for the discounted rates, said Mr Mutandiro. We have realised that the latest trends are now speaking to convergence and as NetOne, we are now in a position to offer such services. So you find that as we go forward we are no longer focussing on one spectrum of a service that we offer as network. We will continue to give more as the needs of our customers evolve, NetOne acting chief operating officer Clever Isaya said at a function where the two new products were launched yesterday.NetOne also plans to launch future products which are beyond the current market needs . As NetOne we are now positioned to say as the customers needs evolve any new demand we will fulfil and we are also taking a proactive role in terms of anticipating customer needs and providing such services, Mr Isaya said.
