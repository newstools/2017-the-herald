LIVERPOOL. Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool are back where they belong, having sealed a Champions League soccer qualifying place. The Reds swept relegated Middlesbrough aside in their final game of the season and Klopp heralded an outstanding job to have finished the campaign with 76 points. The German believes his club have a rightful place among Europe s elite but he is not naive enough to think they will not have to earn a place in the group stage in August. For me it s the best competition, you want to be there and Liverpool needs to be there consistently, he said. I would not say we re already in because qualification is qualification, but we re already looking forward to it. We will be really strong and we will really fight for it because we want to be there. In the last 10 years Liverpool was not part of the Champions League too often; three years ago, once only, maybe. We should try everything to change this. Sky Sports.
