Lewis HamiltonLONDON. Mercedes admit there are no magic bullets to understanding the set-up problems which afflicted Lewis Hamilton in Russia but have vowed to ensure he is able to rediscover top form from Spain onwards. Hamilton finished a race off the podium for the first time since last June with a difficult run to fourth place in Sochi, at the end of a race weekend in which he failed to match race-winning team-mate Valtteri Bottas pace.The Englishman said he had some ideas about what had gone wrong and Mercedes chief Toto Wolff says lots of work has gone in since the last race to understand why his car felt so unbalanced. We have spent our time since then unpicking what happened to understand why we couldn t get the car in the right window so he could feel comfortable with it there are no magic bullets to understanding that, just a lot of hard work and attention to detail, said Wolff. We must give him the tools he needs to do the job in the next races and that will be a big focus for us. Bottas s impressive victory from third on the grid in Sochi a drive described as exceptional by Wolff means Mercedes and Ferrari have now won two races apiece in 2017, with the reigning champions holding a single-point advantage in the Constructors Championship.However, Mercedes are aware they still have work to do to if they are to stay with Ferrari as the season progresses.
