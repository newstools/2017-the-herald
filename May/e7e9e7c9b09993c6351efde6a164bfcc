LONDON. Rugby s leading nations will be hoping for a big slice of luck at today s 2019 World Cup draw, where seedings stacked with dangerous teams could throw up more than one Pool of Death . More than two years before the tournament in Japan, the draw ceremony in historic Kyoto could go a long way to deciding who will lift the trophy in Yokohama on November 2, 2019. England fell victim to a nightmare scenario at the last World Cup, where the hosts failed to reach the knock-out stages after being drawn against Wales, Australia, Fiji and Uruguay.This time around, for the tournament s first edition in Asia, New Zealand, England, Australia and Ireland make up the top seeds to be divided among the four pools of five.
