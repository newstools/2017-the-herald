Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE will this year host the All-Africa Blackball Pool Championships at the City Sports Centre from August 28 to September 2. Twenty one member nations are expected for the prestigious tournament organised by AAPA. Team Zimbabwe, affectionately known as the Fish Eagles, was selected through a competitive tournament at Tanza Centre in Chitungwiza on May 13 and 14 in an event that saw some rookies making it into the team.The Zimbabwe Pool Association president Godknows Marawanyika said they are happy to be given an opportunity to host the high profile tournament. Zimbabwe was selected to host the 2017 edition of this prestigious tournament at the previous event held in Uganda in 2016 because of our conduct at the last two tournaments in Lesotho and Uganda. We gave the AAPA Executive board a lot of confidence in our ability as a nation to host an event of such magnitude. The selection was historic as we have young and very talented players, below the age of 20 in the form of Saidi Office and Takudzwa Matawu, defying all odds and making it into the national team which is usually dominated by big names such as Hillary Bhudhi Mukamuri, Tendai The Inspector Mubaiwa to mention but a few. In the women s category, the magician Christine Sengwe was unstoppable and proved why she deserves the title of Pool Mother of Zimbabwe as she dominated the tables from the first whistle, said Marawanyika.&nbsp;
