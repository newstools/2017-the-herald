Sikhumbuzo Moyo in BULAWAYO How Mine. . . . . . . . (1) 2 Black Rhinos . . . . (1) 1 A FIRED-UP How Mine dominated visiting Black Rhinos and handed the army side their second defeat of the season at Luveve yesterday. The hosts surged into the lead in the fourth minute when Toto Banda worked his way past the visitors defence of skipper Bruce Homora and the gangly Sydney Linyama before firing past goalkeeper Herbert Rusawo.How Mine got their second and winning goal from the hard-working Kuda Musharu, who reacted swiftly to a rebound after Milton Ncube s strike in the 79th minute came back into play.Stanford Stix MtizwaRhinos coach Stanford Stix M tizwa claimed referee Allan Bhasvi, who had a firm grip on the match, should have blown for offside. I feel the goal was scored from an offside position, said M tizwa.His side had scored a beauty a minute before half-time through Lot Chiwunga. A swift counter attack engineered by left-winger Milton Kureva, who switched the ball to an overlapping Jameson Mukombwe, saw the right-back laying a cross that was met first time by Chiwunga to beat How Mine goalie Munyaradzi Diya.The home side though should have won the match by a wider margin had Banda and the wasteful Pascal Manhanga utilised chances that came their way. It s a well deserved three points. We controlled the game from the beginning to the end and created a number of chances, but the way we conceded was rather soft, although we are happy we managed to get maximum points, said Kaindu.Teams:How Mine: M.
