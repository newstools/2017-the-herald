Innocent Ruwende Senior Reporter Poor access to appropriate technologies and finance to implement various climate and developmental interventions that reduce poverty levels is exacerbating Zimbabwe s climate challenges, Environment, Water and Climate Secretary Mr Prince Mupazviriho has said. Mr Mupazviriho said the life and death situations presented by climate change called for the need to review the country s infrastructure and systems in view of the increasing climate-induced extremes.He said this in a speech read on his behalf by director of finance, administration and human resources in the ministry Ms Cathrine Madanha-Maveneki at the Climate Technology Centre and Network Capacity-Building Module for Green Climate Fund (GCF) Concept Note Development workshop in Harare last Friday. The impacts of global climate change and variability are becoming more evident with increased incidences of droughts, floods, hailstorms, more hot days and heat waves. The recent 2015/ 2016 El Nino-induced drought left over four million people without food, he said. In places such as Lupane, school going children could not attend lessons for a full first term of 2017 as absence of climate-resilient infrastructure such as bridges made it impossible for students to cross the rivers such as Tshangani and Mbembesi to school. He said pregnant women and other vulnerable groups could not cross neither to hospitals or access other key facilities.
