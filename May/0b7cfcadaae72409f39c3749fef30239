Lloyd ChitembwePaul Mundandi Sports Reporter LLOYD Chitembwe has saluted Zimbabwean fans for rallying behind the CAPS United family to help them beat Algerian giants USM Alger in a CAF Champions League tie at the National Sports Stadium on Wednesday. Makepekepe won 2-1. When you represent the nation it s not me and my family. It is not only the CAPS United institution but it s something that brings together the whole nation. This is what I found out on Wednesday. National interest was at stake and all the people were brought together. We might have different views and we might support different teams but when it comes to the national interest we are one. The support we got from the fans at the stadium, the support we got from those who were watching the game live on television lifted us. I know a number of people were supporting us from various parts of Zimbabwe, Southern Africa and the world over. I was touched to see some Dynamos fans joining the CAPS United fans to support us, the Mbare Chimurenga choir, some Highlanders fans and all the Premiership clubs rallied behind us. Words might fail me but a big thank you to everyone. I hope this will continue for every team that will represent Zimbabwe. We must have national pride at stake and as a coach I will always strive to do better and I have the same feeling for my players and I have the same feeling for all the players that will represent Zimbabwe in any sporting discipline, said Chitembwe.ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa was also part of the crowd at the stadium while former Kiglon boss Thompson Dondo, who is also the chief executive officer for Impala Holdings, also weighed in by sponsoring 100 fans to support Makepekepe.The deal was brokered by the Zimbabwe National Supporters Association and the fans were also given golf shirts and refreshments.
