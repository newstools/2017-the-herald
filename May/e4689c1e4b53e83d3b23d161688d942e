SOWETO. England-born Stuart Baxter was officially unveiled as South Africa national soccer team coach on Monday on a five-year contract and said winning was all that mattered. Asked at a media conference in Soweto if he would encourage players to nutmeg opponents in the South African penalty area, he replied: No, I would not. Winning is of paramount importance, stressed the 63-year-old as he began a second spell in charge of Bafana Bafana (The Boys). Our supporters want to see winning football with a South African stamp and we have enough quality players to be very competitive. AFP.
