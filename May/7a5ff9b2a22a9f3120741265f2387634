SOUTHAMPTON. Jose Mourinho says the English Premier League s unwillingness to help Manchester United prepare for their Europa League soccer final will force him to pick youth players against Crystal Palace on Sunday. United finish their league campaign against Palace at Old Trafford before facing Ajax in the Europa League final in Stockholm next Wednesday, a game they must win to qualify for next season s Champions League.With nothing riding on Sunday s game for either United or Palace, who are assured of avoiding relegation, Mourinho believes it should have been moved forward a day. In any country in the world, the match would be Saturday because Sunday, we are sixth, doesn t matter what, and Crystal Palace is safe, the United manager told reporters after Wednesday night s 0-0 draw at Southampton. So I think after the moment Crystal Palace beat Hull City and Hull City is relegated, and Swansea is safe, I think in that moment, the match has to be Saturday. In any country in the world, it would be Saturday. It s going to be Sunday. It s frustrating for me. And I hope you don t kill me when you see my team. AFP.
