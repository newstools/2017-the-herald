LONDON. Anthony Taylor stayed nice and calm despite a frenetic start to the FA Cup final and got the first massive decision correct. Arsenal were dominating possession and in the fourth minute the ball fell to Alexis Sanchez from David Luiz headed clearance.The ball appeared to strike his outstretched hand but play continued as the ball looped into the penalty area towards Aaron Ramsey who was clearly in an offside position.Assistant referee Gary Beswick flagged, far too quickly, as Ramsey, realising he was offside stepped aside for Sanchez to score.Taylor waited and calmly went over to Beswick, whose body language showed he knew he had erred, and after a short conversation the goal was awarded. From an offside perspective it was the correct decision as Ramsey didn t touch the ball or interfere with an opponent.What wasn t conclusive was whether Sanchez handled the ball in the build up. A fascinating start to the Cup final. Mailonline
