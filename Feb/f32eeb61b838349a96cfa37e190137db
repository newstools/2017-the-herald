Adele with her 5 Grammy AwardsHappy weekend, I hope you are catching up well. Congrats to Adele for scooping the most awards at the Grammy s Awards 2017 last weekend. Queen Beyonce, damn girl you nailed it with a scintillating performance.Opps, that chair and obvious the twins could have made the superpower punch.Beyonce at the Grammy&#8217;sEnough on the Grammy s as tonight our own National Arts Merit Awards roar into life.Come to think of it, last year was set alight with Chipawo children doing an opening act, which was marvellous.I don t know what the organisers have in store this time around.We will find out tonight.News beyond our borders warns us of the oncoming Cyclone Dineo which is said to be from Mozambique.I urge teens to desist from crossing flooded rivers those who will be walking from school.And if you see that the heavy rains are approaching, please stay indoors and don t tempt to play in the rains.Okay, we must admit that the Lego Batman is super-slick and silly but it s relentless gags and the delights of the voice cast are built for grown ups. Don t you think so?Most of the relentless gags, both verbal and visual, as well as the delights of the voice cast (Mariah Carey voices Gotham City s mayor, for example), will sail over the heads of the under-12s.That considerable caveat aside, it s uproarious fun, as Will Arnett s self-absorbed, insufferably vain Batman hard on crime, easy on the eye comes to realise that he and his ego aren t enough, that only by teaming up with his accidentally adopted sidekick Robin (Michael Cera), loyal butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes) and the new police commissioner (Rosario Dawson), can he hope to save Gotham from the dastardly intentions of the Joker (Zach Galifianakis).Back to gadgetmania, we hear that the sturdy brick of the fallen Nokia empire, the trusty 3310 handset, could be making a return to market 17 years after its initial launch.Known for its long-lasting battery, putting modern handsets to shame and a powerful frame that made cosmetic damage almost impossible, the phone could be making a return with an announcement at MWC in Barcelona.The dumb phone still holds the record for bestselling phone, at 126m unit sales over a sustained period of five years from 2000.Now, Nokia appears to have licenced out the model to manufacturer HMD Oy Global, a Finnish manufacturer taking the place of the company s devices wing which was sold to Microsoft in 2014.Wayne Guthrie, co-founder of innovation consultancy Fearlessly Frank, said: I think it s a great idea and at the right time.Launching something that is like an old friend without any of the addictive traits of smartphones is a great idea. &nbsp;
