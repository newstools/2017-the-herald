Talking to Cool Lifestyle during World Radio Day commemorations at Takashinga Cricket Grounds in Highfield, students from different schools and colleges in the area expressed joy and gratitude in the role that radio has played in educating young people to be responsible citizens in the country.A student, Theresa Ncube, called for radio stations to increase the number of programmes aimed at youth development which are crafted and presented by the young generation. With an increase in number of radio stations in the country it is high time that players in this industry begin to invest in the young generation by establishing a radio station for the youths by the youths so that all our needs are catered for and it will be a platform to nature new radio personalities who will take radio to the next level in the near future, she said.Ncube said most stations were busy focusing on promoting their content through a number of programmes for the youths without actually involving them hence the top-down approach was suicidal as it will not really address any problems but create more challenges for the youths. We are facing challenges as young people who would want to be radio personalities in the near future because we don t get enough time to broadcast but only on certain days like the international children s day of broadcasting. A day is not good enough and it does not give us enough time to learn and develop a strong and informed desire to take up carriers in such a domain hence many end up being musicians as it is the only high way to be on radio she saidAnother young listener Morris Hove applauded radio stations for offering a variety of programmes and at the same time saluted Star FM for an awesome drive time slot. Radio in general has been a key medium in the weaving of society and as a student l have enjoyed programmes from some of these stations as l have an unlimited opportunity to tune in to any station that I feel can cater for my needs at a certain point and time. Above all I salute Star FM which has come in as a game changer from the traditional broadcasting style that l have been accustomed to, it has a more modern but fun-filled kind of broadcasting with the drive time being the best of all slots in my view, said HoveSome students who thronged the cricket grounds also had a day to remember as they had face to face encounters with their favorite radio personalities who took time to answer to their questions and also offer photo opportunitiesTarisai Sithole of Kwayedza High School in the area called for radio stations to have several outdoor broadcasting activities as they are key in motivating other young people in following their dreams. To me it is a day to remember and a dream come true for l have always dreamt of meeting some of my favourite radio personalities, to be honest these are the stars that I can reach for in my world.They represent everything and they are a sign of encouragement and a cloud of possibilities she saidWorld radio day was held under the theme Radio is You with a special basis towards involving young people as the medium plays a pivotal role in the transformation of youths and shaping a better future.The day was also punctuated by music and dance from difference local artists.
