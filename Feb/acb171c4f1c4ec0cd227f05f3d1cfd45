MANCHESTER. &#8211; Wayne Rooney has dismissed talk of a possible move to China and said he wants to remain at Manchester United.Rooney (31) had been strongly linked with a transfer to the Chinese Super League, where the transfer window closes on Tuesday, with a source telling ESPN FC that his agent was in China to speak to interested clubs. However, the United captain, in a statement released by the English Premier League club, said that while he was grateful of the interest, he has no intention of leaving Old Trafford this season. Despite the interest which has been shown from other clubs, for which I m grateful, I want to end recent speculation and say that I am staying at Manchester United, Rooney said. I hope I will play a full part in helping the team in its fight for success on four fronts. &#8211; ESPN.
