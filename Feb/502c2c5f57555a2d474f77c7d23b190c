Paul Mundandi Sports Reporter MADAGASCAR Football Association boss Ahmad Ahmad has boldly declared that he has already won the CAF presidential election. Ahmad is a member of CAF s executive committee. I already feel that I have won the election. It is my hope that I am going to be voted into office and I hope most people will respect the choice by the presidents, said Ahmad. My colleagues asked me to stand after I appeared to be the only man who had the guts to stand against Mr Hayatou from the 54 member countries. It is my hope that I will get all the support. I want to change and make a better CAF. The current one is obsolete. It s no longer useful and if I can be precise, the current one is dead. We need to resurrect it and it s only the presidents who can help me make a change. Hayatou is no longer useful to the African football. He said he has the experience to run football on the continent. I feel I have the much-needed experience. . . I feel I will add value and rebrand CAF, said the 57-year-old.
