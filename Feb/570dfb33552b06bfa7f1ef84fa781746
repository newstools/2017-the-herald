Tawanda Matanhire: Arts CorrespondentArt has for decades been a way of living for many, with stars becoming famous through visual art, music and film among other forms. As young people join the industry pursuing different disciplines, it is wise for them to learn from others who have made it big so that talent is passed on from generation to generation.It is in this regard that Gallery Delta held an exhibition titled Artists in the Stream VIII , which is this year s edition of the annual showcase.The annual exhibitions are targeted at improving the work of upcoming visual artists.The tutoring exhibition, which saw 30 upcoming artists showcasing their work, exposed untamed talent and 11 of the artists walked away with book prizes.The aim of the exhibition was to help budding visual artists improve their work.Co-founder of Gallery Delta, Helen Lieros, said that there is so much talent in the country which needed to be harnessed so that many young artists realise their full potential. Upcoming artists need support so we organized this exhibition with the view that they learn from some of the big names in the visual arts sector and they are able to realise their full potential and live their dreams, she said.They showcased artworks made of steel, watercolour, dry point, chalk, serigraph, gouache, oil on paper, acrylic on canvas, oil on canvas, lino print, string drawing, multimedia and mixed media on canvas to mention a few.Lieros said that many of the artists they have groomed have participated internationally and she is satisfied to see young artists rise. We take in the artists, we nurture them, we mentor them, we develop them and give them some status. Most of our artists have participated internationally in Berlin, Venice, and in South Africa and today they are recognized internationally. To me this is a satisfaction to see young artists rising, she said.Several art critiques walked into the gallery to see and also air their views on the art pieces that were on display.Most of the upcoming artists with the work on exhibition welcomed the idea saying it is with this support they will be able to grow to be seasoned.
