From Gilbert Munetsi in MASVINGO Zimdancehall is set for massive decentralisation with a number on the genre s A-list reportedly trekking to the city of Masvingo, not to tour the monumental Great Zimbabwe, but to seek the services of a local producer, Liberty Chaira, who has established a state-of-the-art studio and engaged the services of one of the best producers by the name of Gabriel Ndale (aka DJ Ceeklear). Recent arrivals to the stable that is located in Runyararo West include Lady Squanda and the Youth president, Spiderman, who were recently in the city to pen a contract with the musical establishment that has also worked as manager, partner or promoter for the likes of Prince Musarurwa, Andy Muridzo, PTK, D Flex, Byt, Jah Stonny, Jnr O, Flexxer, Thunder T, Mankind, TJ, DJ Sky, DJ Sparks, DJ Snot, DJ Nkulu and DJ Kauleza.King Lee (as Chaira is popularly known in the Zimdancehall circles) is not a new arrival on the musical scene, having also worked with the likes of Plot Mhako in the Jibilika Dance Trust project way back in 2008. When I moved to this city in 2012 in search of employment, I met Ndale and the encounter has given birth to Ceeklear Studios, also referred to here in Masvingo as The House of Sweet Music . Our biggest asset is our highly qualified producer, who comes into the arrangement armed with a degree in Sound Engineering obtained from Damelin Bramley College in SA. I am an ideal complement to the whole setup as I am a computer expert and when it comes to quality, we do not compromise, given our respective professional backgrounds. We are currently working on a new riddim called KingKleer and this is a collaboration between ourselves trading as CeeKlear Music and Kinglee Promotions, said the 35-year-old Chaira who is employed by N Richards as the branch manager for Masvingo.Chaira is a product of St Thomas Secondary School, and is an only child in his family.Married to Ropafadzo Zingoni, the couple has been blessed with two boys, Munenyasha and Munovongwa.The Masvingo producer concedes it is not a stroll in the park to involve oneself in the music industry as he has had to finance more than five artistes who are not employed and this, he says, ranges from buying them airtime right up to feeding them. Then there is also the challenge to balance work, family business and the music project itself, and I must hasten to say it is very overwhelming but I am managing. The long-term objective is to grow the studio into an internationally-recognised venture and make the rest of the most popular artistes follow the great trek to Masvingo. Of-course, our local artistes out here in Masvingo are set to be the biggest beneficiaries in the equation and with the opening up of the airwaves, we pray their works will find outlets that will give them the much desired exposure, said Chaira.
