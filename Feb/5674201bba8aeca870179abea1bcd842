1 Corinthians 14 vs 40 Let all things be done decently and in order So many people expect to achieve exceptional results in the midst of chaos and disorder in their lives. They sometimes wonder why things never work out despite the endless prayers and the apparent grace in their lives.We sometimes forget that we serve a God of order, everything about the Bible strengthens the notion of a Maker who is particular about detail and order. He created everything to follow a set order, the sun will set and rise at about the same time every day in a similar pattern and it will always rise in the East and set in the West.In the same manner, when He gave Moses instructions on how to build the tabernacle, He was very specific and detailed about everything; including the material, dimensions, colours, amounts and even the model that was to be followed in the construction of the tabernacle. He also gave specific instructions to the children of Israel pertaining to the sacrifices and offerings that they were supposed to present before Him.Yet, even as we are equipped with this knowledge, we keep fooling ourselves, believing that success can be achieved in disorder. Everything about our lives must follow some form of structure. We should have order in the way we pray, worship, follow through on past prayers and in how we hand in particular petitions and requests to the Lord.It is our duty and responsibility to emulate the characteristics of our Maker. We should seek to know Him and, when we do, we must apply that knowledge to our quest of making our dreams come true, guided by His will.Declutter your life today and create order and structure in everything you do, live in strict accordance to His instructions. Through this one small act you can begin the journey to unlocking unlimited blessings.Be blessed!REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS. . .For More Info:Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.orgEmail us on [email&#160;protected]Catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
