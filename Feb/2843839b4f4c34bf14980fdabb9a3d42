LONDON. Jurgen Klopp is on Barcelona s wanted list as under-fire Luis Enrique prepares to exit the Nou Camp. The charismatic Liverpool coach finds himself in demand as Barcelona look to change coach in the summer. Enrique has been branded an under achiever following Barca s 4-0 Champions League humbling last week against Paris Saint-Germain. Klopp is on an extensive list of preferred replacements and one which includes his Merseyside neighbour, Everton manager Ronald Koeman.Koeman is the favoured option if Barcelona go down the route of recruiting a former playing hero to become their coach.There is also a rich tradition of Dutch coaches bringing success to the Nou Camp including Johan Cruyff, Frank Rijkaard and Louis van Gaal.Klopp has his admirers within the Nou Camp, especially for his work at Borussia Dortmund. The German is a huge fan of Barcelona s football and took his Liverpool players to watch Barca s Champions League game against Borussia Monchengladbach in December.Liverpool will be hoping the call from Barcelona never comes having placed their long term future in Klopp s hands in the shape of a new six-year contract.
