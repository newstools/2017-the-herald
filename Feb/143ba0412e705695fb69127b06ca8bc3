MADRID. Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane hailed the impact of Isco and Alvaro Morata off the bench as the European soccer champions came from 2-0 down at Villarreal on Sunday to win 3-2. Morata completed the comeback after Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo had hauled Madrid level to ensure Zidane s men move back ahead of Barcelona at the top of La Liga.Real hold a one-point lead over their title rivals, who won 2-1 at Atletico Madrid on Sunday, but also have a game in hand. They deserve (to play) more for sure, Zidane said of the Spanish international duo. They did very well, they changed the game. In any case we will need every player between now and the end of the season. They are all up for it. It is a long season, but this shows that everyone is ready when they are called upon. With everything that happened today it was vitally important to get the three points. Real had suffered just their second league defeat of the season at Valencia in midweek.And Zidane s men looked well on course to suffer another reversal when Villarreal struck twice in six minutes early in the second-half through Manu Trigueros and Cedric Bakambu.However, Zidane reacted immediately by introducing Isco for the more defensively minded Casemiro. Having been outplayed for the opening hour, Madrid forced Villarreal onto the back foot and were rewarded when Bale s header halved the arrears 25 minutes from time. AFP.
