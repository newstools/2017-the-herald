The year-on-year inflation rate for the month of January 2017 stood at -0,65 percent, gaining 0,28 percentage points on the December 2016 rate of -0,93 percent , said the Agency.Inflation last averaged -0,2 percent in 2014 and has been on an upward spiral since July 2016 when it recorded a relatively lower rate of -1,6 percent.Prices of bread and cereals, which have a weight of 10,98 percent to the total consumer price index, surged by 1,86 percent. Fish and sea food prices also rose by 1,1 percent.

The premium is then passed to the final consumer, which increases the general price level.Gas prices however took a -9,17 percent dip, with actual rental for housing falling by -6,39 percent, while the prices of fruit also fell by -7,97 percent.As the Government is targeting to increase aggregate production in the economy this year, driven by the 2017 National Budget theme Pushing production frontiers across all sectors of the economy it is important that more concrete supply side interventions be put in place to abet the operations of productive sectors.The country s month-on-month food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation rate also significantly jumped up to 0,80 percent in January 2017, gaining by 0,42 percent on the December 2016 rate of 0,38 percent.
