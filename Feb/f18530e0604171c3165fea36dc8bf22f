You know that battery, which is written Everready, always yielding power. We stand ready all the time, but the issue is that of ensuring unity within us. The quarrels within the party, suspicions within the party, we are remedying those ones. So, it will not take us time to be in full gear. We do not have differences that can really mar our participation in the election. We have been at this game for a long time and we are not vana Zim (People) First. It s born in the morning and before sunset, it has become something else.

Well, where are we infiltrating them? he asked. Have they given us the persons? Infiltration is an act of getting your people clandestinely into their organisations. Infiltrate MDC-T, kuti tidii? We haven t done such a thing. It s failures on their part and quarrels, of course, within them.

Day in, day out, just attacks on us, zanu-pf, something about Mugabe, something about the First Lady, to sell their organs. But what do they talk about? Our industries, by way of policies that they envisage, mining industry, agriculture, the utilities, infrastructure? What are the policies that they have in these areas of the sectors of our economy?
