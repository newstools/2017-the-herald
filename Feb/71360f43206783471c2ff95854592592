MELBOURNE. &#8211; Former skipper Steve Waugh has warned that Australia s only hope of beating India in their upcoming series is by taming Ravichandran Ashwin, branding the record-breaking spinner the Bradman of bowling . After the offspinner became the fastest bowler to claim 250 test wickets last weekend, Waugh paid Ashwin the ultimate Australian compliment by comparing him to the game s greatest batsman, the late Donald Bradman. He is the Bradman of bowling. Ashwin is doing what Don Bradman did with batting. Pretty incredible stuff and he is a handy batsman too, Waugh was quoted as saying in the Times of India on Wednesday. Ashwin is the player that Australia have to overcome and probably then we have a chance. His record in India is just phenomenal, said Waugh, who was attending an awards ceremony in Monaco.Australia have not won a test in India since their 2-1 series victory in 2004 and few observers give them much hope of success this time round against what is currently the world s No 1 ranked team.India are on a record-breaking 19-test unbeaten run and have also won six series on the trot under the captaincy of their star batsman, Virat Kohli.Ashwin is the team s undoubted star bowler, ranked No 1 in test bowling rankings and top of the allrounders list after picking up 61 wickets in the last three series &#8211; all of them at home. &#8211; AFP.
