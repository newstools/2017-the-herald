The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Projects (SERAP) has called on King Mswati III of Swaziland and the chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) to convene an emergency summit of the Sadc Heads of State and Government to deliberate on the persistent xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreign nationals living in South Africa.The group also asked SADC to use the organ on politics, defence and security cooperation within SADC to immediately set up an independent and impartial body to investigate all facts and reports of xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreign nationals.In a letter dated February 24, 2017, and signed by SERAP executive director Adetokunbo Mumuni, the organisation said the persistent and longstanding xenophobic attacks on Nigerians and other foreign nationals, the complete impunity of perpetrators and the failure by the authorities to provide an effective remedy and reparation to victims directly undermine Sadc mandates on regional integration and human rights. We are also concerned about the failure of the South African authorities to provide an effective remedy and reparation to victims, reads the letter.The letter states that SERAP is seriously concerned about the complicity of the South African authorities and officials in persistent and serious human rights violations and abuses against thousands of Nigerians living in the country and the failure of the authorities to exercise due diligence to prevent those violations and abuses. We are also concerned about the failure of the South African authorities to provide an effective remedy and reparation to victims, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. According to SERAP, Nigerians and other foreign nationals in South Africa are living in fear of attacks as the South African authorities have failed to protect them or guarantee their security and safety.The group said they concerned that over 100 Nigerians have been unlawfully killed and their properties and businesses destroyed in the country where they work and live in the past two years as a result of xenophobic attacks.SERAP, therefore, calls Sadc to convene an emergency summit of Sadc Heads of State and Government to deliberate on the issue with a view to putting pressure on the South African authorities to provide a long-term security guarantee to all Nigerians and other foreign nationals in the country.The group also urges the government of South Africa to take immediate steps to guarantee the safety and human rights of all Nigerians and other foreign nationals living in the country. &#8211; Africa News,
