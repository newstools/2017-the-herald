LONDON. Britain s four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah on Sunday insisted he was a clean athlete after a leaked United States Anti-Doping Agency report suggested that his coach had almost certainly broken anti-doping rules. I am a clean athlete who has never broken the rules in regards to substances, methods or dosages and it is upsetting that some parts of the media, despite the clear facts, continue to try to associate me with allegations of drug misuse, Farah said in a statement. As I ve said many times before we all should do everything we can to have a clean sport and it is entirely right that anyone who breaks the rules should be punished. The USADA on Saturday confirmed it had compiled a dossier on controversial coach Alberto Salazar following a report accusing the athletics guru of dangerously using drugs to boost the performance of his athletes. Britain s Sunday Times said the dossier obtained by the Fancy Bears hacking group had found Salazar abused prescription drugs and experimented with infusions of a research supplement based on the amino acid L-carnitine at his base.
