President Zuma on Wednesday last week met with his ministers from the justice, crime prevention and security cluster to discuss a strategy to respond to crime more vigorously in the many hotspots around the country.He said it was wrong for South Africans to solely blame all criminal activities on foreigners. Let us isolate those who commit such crimes and work with government to have them arrested, without stereotyping and causing harm to innocent people, he said. The threats and counter-threats on social media must stop. All must exercise restraint, respect the laws of the land and work together to fight crime and build safer communities. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) condemned xenophobic violence in Pretoria and Johannesburg and called for peaceful coexistence between locals and foreigners.The party blamed Johannesburg mayor Mr Herman Mashaba, saying he incited the violence in Gauteng with his comments made about foreigners in December last year.Mr Mashaba came under fire for referring to foreigners as criminals and inciting violence when he told journalists that illegal immigrants got to South Africa criminally and should be treated as such. Mr Mashaba has denied he s to blame, saying he s deeply concerned about xenophobic attacks.ANC spokesperson Mr Zizi Kodwa called on law enforcement agents to deal decisively with perpetrators of violence.The chairman of the Zimbabwean Community in South Africa, Mr Ngqabutho Mabhena, said there was a third force behind the attacks, accusing some opposition parties of trying to destabilise the ANC-led government.Violence broke out during last Friday s anti-immigrant march in Pretoria and parts of Johannesburg.Police had to use stun grenades, water cannons and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters going by the name Mamelodi Concerned Residents who accused immigrants of taking our jobs, fuelling crime and prostitution. Dozens of foreign-owned shops and properties have been looted in Pretoria West, Mamelodi and Atteridgeville over the last two weeks.Earlier this month, locals in Rosettenville, in southern Johannesburg, torched 12 houses believed to be drug dens and brothels.
