Kim Jong-NamKUALA LUMPUR. &#8211; Malaysian police said yesterday they believe five North Koreans were involved in the murder of the half-brother of leader Kim Jong-Un, with four having fled the country on the day of the killing. Seoul said the announcement proved Pyongyang was behind the murder of Kim Jong-Nam, who died after being squirted in the face with an unidentified liquid at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday last week.The case has also sparked a diplomatic row between Pyongyang and Kuala Lumpur, after Malaysia rejected demands quickly to hand the body over to the North.Four North Korean men were being sought over the killing, Deputy Inspector-General of Police Noor Rashid Ibrahim told a press conference, in addition to their 46-year-old compatriot Ri Jong Chol who was arrested in Kuala Lumpur Saturday.Suspects Ri Ji Hyon, O Jong Gil, Ri Jae Nam and Hong Song Sac, aged between 33 and 57, entered Malaysia in February or late January, the police chief said.Three more North Koreans were wanted for questioning, he said.Officers have already arrested one North Korean, an Indonesian woman and her Malaysian boyfriend, as well as a Vietnamese woman. Considering that five suspects are North Korean nationals, we view that the North Korean government is behind the incident, Seoul s unification ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-Hee said immediately after Sunday s announcement.The deputy police chief refused to comment on any political motive for the killing, saying only that investigations were on- going.Pyongyang has demanded Jong-Nam s body be returned but Malaysia has said it must remain in the country until it is identified through a DNA sample from a family mem- ber. We are trying very hard to get the next of kin to come and assist us in the investigation, Noor Rashid said, but added no such family member had yet come forward.Police were still waiting for the results of an autopsy conducted on Wednesday, he said. &#8211; AFP.
