This year s edition, organised by the Cape Town-based events company Shamstone Production and Entertainment, will be headlined by social media exponent Rumbidzai Florida Mapeto. The awards will be held at the Kelvin Grove Conference Centre in Newlands, Cape Town.In a statement, Zimbabwe Excellence Awards executive director Julius Shamu said: Coming from a successful 2nd Edition of the Zimbabwe Excellence Awards 2016 which saw the winners of small business category The N7 farmers gracing the headlines throughout the world, we are buoyant of the 3rd Edition of the Awards event with much anticipation of who is going to break the record set by the farmers. The N7 farmers, who were mentioned by former South African President Thabo Mbeki in one of his famous lectures have turned a Malmesbury farmland which was lying fallow into productive land.Shamu said the awards remain committed to bringing people from all walks of life together, to recognise, acknowledge and reward excellence. Despite the enormous challenges of those running their businesses in the diaspora, individuals and companies continue to be resilient and continue to excel in their various projects and businesses, he said.The awards seek to honour individuals and organisations that have remained a source of inspiration to the rest of the Zimbabwean community in South Africa. The build-up to the awards started by calling for nominations which began in earnest mid-November 2016 till mid December 2016. Contrary to reports the nomination process ran for a month which gave people the opportunity to nominate those whom they deemed fit to be doing well and raising the Zimbabwean and South African flags high. This was circulated on most social media pages and reached a wide audience. The judges received this information and came up with a short-list which they handled according to set criteria. Shamu said the awards would also honour a few individuals who have played a significant role in the Zimbabwean community for many years through a recognition award. There s a lot to expect this year from entertainment to networking with some of our invited guests led by our Cape Town consular general Mr Bonface Mugobogobo, he said.Some of the sponsors and partners for this year awards event include: Mukuru Money Transfer, Impress Clothing, Shamstone Production, Uhuru Management Training in Africa, Maps Graphics, Wakati Trust, AV Studios, Standard Film, ACT African Restaurant, Bra Stu Driving School and Dream World Promotions.The Cape Town Zimbabwe Excellence Awards were initiated by Julius Shamu with the aim of bringing the Zimbabwean community in the Mother City together while celebrating their achievements.The awards acknowledge the excellence of Zimbabweans based in Cape Town in their successes in various fields.They also seek to recognise and acknowledge individuals and businesses that are flying the Zimbabwean flag high.Organisers work in trying to assist the Zimbabwean Community in Cape Town through various initiatives such as sports, media, academic, businesses, and entertainment.The awards are also meant to showcase to the South African community the positive contribution being made by Zimbabweans in Cape Town.Past winners of the awards include Godfrey Madanhire (Overall winner), Tinashe Chaterera (Sports Personality of the Year), 2015 Business Organisation of the Year Award Moreboys Munetsi, Albert Zanganembo (Entertainment).Voting closes on March 18, 2017 on the website http://zimexcellenceawards.com/votingBelow are the nominees:Businessman of the year awardStuart MugabeShakespear MangaziraMoreboys MunetsiBright ChimutashuCharles MandazaJackson MukahananaPatson Lunga****Business Organisation of the year awardBra Stu Driving SchoolChiwha ToursZororo PhumlaniZondex TVLeopard RemovalsEden All NaturalDharican InternationalKubu Restaurant****Businesswoman of the year awardFaith Mukwakwamu (Exclusive hair Saloon)Medwine Mazonde (Maiguru hair saloon)Belinda (Bump &amp; Ride)Rejoice Debra Matake (Eden All Natural)****Small business of the year awardDengu Online GroceriesMaps GraphicsWasilla ProjectsNcore Financials****Music GroupAfricentiq Culture (Shamie)GwenyambiraKingdom Sensation****Community leader of the year awardEdmore Mazungunye (Mother s love educare &amp; Marinatha home of the elderly)Zimbo Awa (Aviation Foundation)Nqobizitha Hobane (Ukhozi girls)Delphino Machikicho (Waumbe Youth Development)****Journalist/NewleaderSimon Manda (This ability Newspaper)Tariro Washinyira (Ground up)****Entertainment Personality of the year awardWitness Morgan Chasara (DJ Wity Morgan Stitch)Lewis Durango (DJ King Lad)Petros Chimombe (DJ Pliers)Winnet Chinyanga (DJ Winnie)****Personality of the year awardInnocent ChakanyukaTinashe ChingwaruKudzai Richard NdoroTinashe Nyamudoka****Young upcoming entrepreneur of the year awardElite Models (Takudzwa Kamukondiwa)Previous Kakora (Crotchet Designs)Munyaradzi Nkomo (Immigration Specialists)Kelvin Manlee (Manlee Construction)****Artist of the yearLloyd Mponda (King Labash)Lencoine Shumbayaonda (Carter B)Munashe Lawrence (Goba)Edmore MazungunyeElvis MagazeniTawanda Quinton Chikowore (PS Quint)****DJ of the year awardWitness Morgan Chasara (DJ Morgan Stitch)Lewis Durango (DJ King Lad)Petros Chimombe (DJ Pliers)Winnet Chinyanga (DJ Winnie).
