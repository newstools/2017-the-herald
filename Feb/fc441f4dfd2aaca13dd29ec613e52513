Anesu Chakabva Herald Reporter Kadoma City Council has introduced a 40 percent discount on outstanding bills to encourage defaulting residents to pay up.The incentive will benefit residents with arrears dating back to September 30, 2016 and the window period will be extended to March 31. The local authority has also introduced 30 percent loyalty discounts for customers who maintain up-to-date bill payments from December 31 last year to June 30 next year.Kadoma City Council chamber secretary Mr Willard Mangwengwende said that the move was meant to encourage rate payers to abide by municipal by-laws. Our intention is to inculcate a culture of paying bills in our clients and residents, he said. The discounts are, therefore, meant to encourage people to pay up. The discounts have nothing to do with what we have been billing. Given a choice we would not do it. It has everything to do with having a dollar in our hands. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. The discounts are conditional and there are due dates to be met in order to enjoy the discounts. The loyal clients who have been paying are also being rewarded for carrying council this far. They will enjoy cash settlement discounts. Bulawayo City Council is also offering discounts to senior citizens to pay 50 percent of their bills.The scheme is meant for people aged 70 years and above.Several city councils and municipalities have been facing challenges with defaulters and this has played a role in the poor service delivery bemoaned by residents.Rate payers have developed a habit of not paying their rates, attributing their failure to the prevailing economic situation, while some say there is no reason for paying as the local authorities are not rendering the services expected.Residents owe Harare City Council $600 million, Gweru $130 million, Masvingo $34 million, while Mutare is owed over $20 million.
