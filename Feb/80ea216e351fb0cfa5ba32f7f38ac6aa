John Manzongo in Victoria Falls Recognition of workers rights is central to national, regional and international development as it is an enabler of stability and sustainable economic development, Government has said. Addressing delegates to the 43rd African Regional Labour Administration Centre (ARLAC) governing council meeting on fundamental principles and rights at work underway here yesterday, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Labour and Public Service Mr Ngoni Masoka urged countries to implement labour conventions. Africa has achieved near universal ratification of the eight core labour conventions as dictated by the International Labour Organisations (ILO), he said. African countries must be congratulated for the high number of ratifications, while further progress in additional ratifications should still be encouraged. In my view, this meeting has come at a very opportune time for ARLAC member states to deliberate on practical ways of effectively implementing the commitments that we have ratified, both in law and practice. Mr Masoka said the relatively high number of African cases that are taken to the International Labour Conference Committee on the application of standards yearly was a sign that many countries were having challenges in domesticating the principles and provisions of the conventions in law and practice. This perspective is, however, not to say that there are no other reasons for the high number of listings from Africa such as the apparent politicisation of cases involving developing countries, he said.Mr Masoka said rights at work constituted one of the four pillars of decent work, along with employment creation, social security and social dialogue.Decent work is an integral component of the Sustainable Development Agenda.Attending the meeting are Government officials and labour experts from 13 African countries.
