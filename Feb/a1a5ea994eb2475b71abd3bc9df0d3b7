LONDON. The fight between Amir Khan and Manny Pacquiao was guaranteed to take place at some point from the first time the pair sparred together in October 2008 at Freddie Roach s Wild Card gym, a hard retreat in the seedy streets of West Hollywood. Roach is a harsh man to hire as a new trainer and he threw Khan, who was fresh from a sixty-second knock-out loss, to Pacquiao as a sacrifice on the Bolton boxer s opening day in the gym. People in the gym asked me if I was doing the right thing, said Roach. I was doing the only thing; I needed to know if Amir still wanted to be a boxer. I found out he did. Khan will fight Pacquiao on April 23 after an online poll rejected an Australian called Jeff Horn as Pacquiao s next opponent, and voted overwhelmingly for a fight against Khan. The fight is set to take place on a Sunday, which would suggest that either Macau, the gambling island a short boat journey from Hong Kong, or the United Arab Emirates is the location. Pacquiao, who is now 38 years-old, has fought twice in Macau, where it was thought he would be based after a lot of bold claims three or four years ago about the island replacing Las Vegas as the boxing capital of the world. However, Pacquiao s last three fights have been in Las Vegas, including his disappointing loss to Floyd Mayweather in 2015. In theory, Pacquiao s WBO welterweight title will be the secondary prize to the cash available, which would mean Khan fighting back in a weight division that makes sense; Khan fought in May last year when he gained nearly ten pounds and lost to Saul Canelo Alvarez.
