Rabat. &#8211; Morocco said on Sunday it will pull back from a zone of the contested Western Sahara that has raised tensions with Algeria-backed Polisario Front separatists. The Kingdom of Morocco will proceed from today with a unilateral withdrawal from the (Guerguerat) zone, the foreign ministry said in a statement. It said the decision was taken by King Mohamed VI at the request of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.Rabat now hopes the secretary general s intervention will allow a return to the previous situation in the zone concerned, keep its status intact, allow the flow of normal road traffic and thus safeguard the ceasefire , it said.In a telephone call to Guterres on Friday, the king called on the United Nations to take urgent measures to end provocation by the Polisario Front threatening a 1991 ceasefire.Morocco insists that the former Spanish colony is an integral part of its kingdom, but the Polisario is demanding a referendum on self-determination.The two sides fought for control of the Western Sahara from 1974 to 1991, with Rabat gaining control of the territory before the UN-brokered ceasefire took effect.In the phone call, Mohamed condemned repeated incursion by armed Polisario men in the Guerguerat district.Tensions flared last year after the Polisario set up a new military post in Guerguerat district near the Mauritanian border, within a stone s throw of Moroccan soldiers.The move came after Morocco last summer started building a tarmac road in the area south of the buffer zone separating the two sides. &#8211; AFP.
