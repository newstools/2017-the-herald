Cde PorusingaziTawanda Mangoma in CHECHECHE Chipinge South Member of Parliament Cde Enock Porusingazi has challenged Government and private players to capitalise on the free-flowing water along Save River and establish more irrigation schemes on the 10 000 hectares of land existing in the district. Speaking to The Herald during a constituency tour recently, Cde Porusingazi said it was disheartening that most water flowing along Save River was bringing no benefits to the people of Zimbabwe, but rather caused problems, especially of drowning and flooding. Indeed, we are not utilising Save River at all, he said. This constituency is in region five (little rainfall) and rarely receives adequate rains except for this year when the whole country has had a lot of rainfall. Naturally, it s always drought after drought, and it s disheartening that we see water flowing daily through Save River going to Mozambique without giving us the much awaited transformation. Cde Porusingazi said the area had potential for the setting up of more irrigation schemes as land and water were readily available. We have more that 10 000 hectares of land which has been naturally surveyed and can be used for irrigation farming, he said. Go to Rimbi area, go to Gumira and Manzvira even up to Jack Quinton Bridge, you can see that this area has potential to be turned into a green belt.
