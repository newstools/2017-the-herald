LONDON. Brexit could kill any bid by England for the World Cup, European Championship or Champions League soccer final, the president of Uefa has warned. Aleksander Ceferin also declared that the 2026 World Cup could not be played in the United States if Donald Trump s Muslim ban prevented players, fans or the media from entering the country for the tournament.Ceferin, elected president of Uefa in September, said European football s governing body remained committed to staging the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 at Wembley.But he added we could have a serious problem if those travelling to the UK for European matches were denied entry post-Brexit.Football Association chairman Greg Clarke last year admitted Great Britain s vote to leave the European Union could damage England s hopes of staging major tournaments.The FA has declared an interest in hosting 2030 World Cup and Euro 2028 and Clarke said it could be forced to enter in a joint bid with an EU member state.
