LONDON. The manager of Sutton United will have no qualms about doing all he can to add to the burden of Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger when their teams meet in the last 16 of the FA Cup. The tie of the fifth round, at least for those who still believe in the romance of the Cup , sees non-league Sutton at home to joint-record 12-times Arsenal on Monday night.Arsenal will make the trip from north to southwest London, for a match on the artificial pitch at Sutton s Gander Green Lane ground, with Wenger under intense pressure following a humiliating 5-1 loss away to German giants Bayern Munich in the first leg of a last 16 Champions League tie.That defeat came hot on the heels of a recent shock league loss to Watford and an ensuing, rather more predictable defeat by Chelsea that between them appeared to have scuppered he Gunners hopes of a first Premier League title since 2004.
