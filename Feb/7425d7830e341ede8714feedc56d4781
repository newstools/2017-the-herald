WELLINGTON. A new Super Rugby season kicks off this week with bosses pledging to tackle its unwieldy conference structure, exhausting travel schedules and lopsided contests. There will be a first fixture in Samoa in June, meaning the 2017 Super Rugby season will now straddle 17 time zones and four continents.The competition will retain the much-criticised four conference format, while tweaking kick-off times to trial Thursday night matches and increase the number of afternoon games. Our biggest challenge is obviously the geographical expanse we ve got to cover, said Andy Marinos, the chief executive of Super Rugby s governing body SANZAAR, while promising that team schedules would be managed better this year. We ve had some key learnings out of 2016 that we can implement into 2017 around how we manage the players during the week and how we work the travel schedule, he said.The far-flung tournament has its critics, notably England s former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones, who bluntly observed last season: Some of the games put me to sleep. With six franchises in South Africa and five each in Australia and New Zealand, plus Japan s Sunwolves, and Argentina s Jaguares, organisers are wrestling with the conflicting interests of the five competing nations.
