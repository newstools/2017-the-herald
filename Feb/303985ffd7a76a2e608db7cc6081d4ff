Peter MutharikaBLANTYRE. &#8211; Malawi President Peter Mutharika has dismissed the agriculture minister after an investigation into claims that the country paid too much money for a delivery of maize from Zambia. President Mutharika ordered an investigation last month into the $34,5 million government maize purchase, following which he sacked George Chaponda, the southern African nation s information minister said yesterday.Chaponda was not immediately available for comment.Zambian opposition leader Saviour Chishimba said in December he had seen documents showing Malawi had been charged $345 per tonne for the 100 000 tonnes of Zambian white maize that was worth $215 a tonne. Shortly after, the president launched the probe.Malawi is importing maize to ease food shortages affecting an estimated 6.7 million people, triggered by a severe drought that swept the region in 2016.Some senior Malawi government officials have said the price was higher because a transport and logistics company had to be hired to move the maize between the neighbouring countries. &#8211; Reuters.
