I was just waiting for my chance to come. Even when Godknows (Murwira) was here, I still felt that I could don the jersey and perform better than him, said Mahaka. His departure was a blessing in disguise to me. Coach Mutasa praised Mahaka. Peace is coming up. He has been commanding a regular jersey in the last four matches.
