Michael FlynnNEW YORK. The resignation of a US national security adviser after only over three weeks in the job is unprecedented and it is a harbinger of something deep in the water. Michael Flynn s quit amid revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his phone calls with Russian ambassador uncovered the chaos facing the new Donald Trump administration, US experts said. It was an unprecedented development for a national security adviser to be forced out just 25 days into Trump s presidency, Nora Bensahel, an expert at the School of International Service of the Washington-based American University, told a telephone briefing on Tuesday. We never heard anything like that before. Flynn s sudden ouster on Monday night was triggered by last week s disclosure that he discussed Washington s sanctions on Moscow during at least one December phone call with Russia s ambassador to the United States before Trump took office on January 20.The retired lieutenant-general was serving as a member of Trump s transition team then. But in particular, he misled other officials about the conversations, including Vice President Mike Pence, who came out and strongly supported him in public comments, Bensahel said. Xinhua.&nbsp;
