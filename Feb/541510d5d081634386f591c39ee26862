Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter DYNAMOS coach Lloyd Mutasa believes star midfielder Denver Mukamba will this season raise his game and illuminate the domestic Premiership.Mutasa and his troops will leave the country for a number of friendlies in Mozambique and the gaffer spoke highly of the players he believes could be key for the Glamour Boys this year. The attacking midfielder re-joined Dynamos during the second half of the 2016 season after spending some few years in South Africa.But the high expectations that Mukamba could explode at DeMbare soon evaporated as he struggled to form in a poor Glamour Boys side.But Mutasa, who gave Mukamba his breakthrough into the top-flight league, still believes in his man. I think Denver is doing well and can be one of the players to look forward to this season. He is one of our senior players and he has proved what he is capable of doing in the past, said Mutasa. The player is focused and is doing some extras even after training, which shows how serious he is this season. We expect some positives from him and he is someone who can change a game any time, so we are happy to be with him this season. I think Denver is a good player with a great talent and he can improve a lot. I am seeing a good attitude from him. We are working as a unit and team work always helps, so we hope to see a rejuvenated Denver this season. The former Bidvest Wits player has suffered from disciplinary issues, with critics saying he lost focus on his game after believing he had already turned into a superstar.Others say off-the-field distractions, since his move to South Africa, have badly derailed his progress.
