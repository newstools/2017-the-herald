LONDON. &#8211; Lee Dixon has joined the growing list of former Arsenal players sensing manager Arsene Wenger will call time on his 21-year spell at the north London club after yet another rollercoaster season. Wenger s future as Arsenal manager will be decided at the end of the season, the BBC reported yesterday without citing sources. There was currently no prospect of Wenger leaving before the summer, it said, hours after Arsenal were thrashed 5-1 away to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.Wenger is out of contract at the end of the season and has yet to accept fresh terms on offer. The decision on his future was expected to be taken mutually by the manager and the club, the report added.The pressure on Wenger is mounting as Arsenal look certain to exit the Champions League at the first knockout stage for the seventh season in a row after the 5-1 demolition by Bayern Munich in the round of 16 first-leg game on Wednesday. It saddens me to see him like that, I know what a winner he is. I think he realises, he seems so low. This team is getting no response from him. I ve never seen him like that before, Dixon, who played under Wenger for six years, told ITV Football. It s so obvious that they fight for so long and then they lose inspiration. He owes it to himself to change that. It is he who will pull the rug from under his own turf. I think he thinks it s time (to go). Ian Wright, Arsenal s second-highest goal-scorer, and Martin Keown, a member of Wenger s squad who went through the 2003-04 Premier League campaign unbeaten, also expect the Frenchman to draw the curtains on his career. &#8211; BBC/Reuters.
