LONDON. &#8211; Ten-man Tottenham Hotspur crashed out of the Europa League in the round of 32 after losing 3-2 on aggregate following Thursday night s 2-2 second-leg draw against Belgian club Gent at Wembley. Harry Kane s own goal and Dele Alli s first-half red card were too much to overcome as Mauricio Pochettino s men failed to reach the quarter-finals of the competition for a fourth consecutive campaign.However, Christian Eriksen gave Tottenham early hope in the 10th minute, levelling the tie with a calm finish past goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic after collecting a speculative long ball behind the Gent defence.Gent complicated things 10 minutes later, securing a crucial away goal with the help of Kane, who from a corner kick mistakenly headed past his own goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. &#8211; ESPN.&nbsp;
