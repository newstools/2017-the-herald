Paul Mundandi Sports Reporter NGEZI Platinum defender Godknows Murwira believes his team have the pedigree to roll past Pamplemousses at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow. Ngezi were dealt a blow when their match was moved from Baobab to Harare after the CAF inspecting committee said Mhondoro-Ngezi had no hotels suitable to host the match officials and players. We respect all our opponents, but we need to show them that Zimbabwe is a footballing nation and we must not be taken for granted, said Murwira. We did not go to AFCOn through the back door. We have the technical team and we have the players who are hungry for success. We have our own stadium, which is state-of-the-art, but we are not worried. Even if we were to play at Barbourfields or in Hwange, we were still going to win because we will be at home. We are geared up to fly the Zimbabwe flag high. I am aware they will throw everything at us, but we are going to ensure that we maintain our advantage. One leg is already in (the first round) despite us conceding a silly goal. I have also gained experience with the call-up to the senior national team and that has made me a better player although I still want to continue working hard and improve so that we achieve more as a team. Ngezi president Stanley Segula had wanted the small community to watch an historic moment with international football being held on their doorstep.Walter Mukanga has been ruled out of the match through injury.
