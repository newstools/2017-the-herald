TURF MOOR. Harry Kane s fifth hat-trick for Tottenham and second this year eased the Premier League club past second-tier Championship side Fulham 3-0 and into the FA Cup quarterfinals on Sunday. The 23-year-old England striker, who took his tally to 19 for the season, ended a difficult week for Spurs and manager Mauricio Pochettino on a winning note following defeats by Liverpool in the league and then Belgian outfit Gent in the Europa League last 32 first leg.Pochettino s team selection reflected his desire for a positive result as he started with Kane, Dele Alli, Victor Wanyama and Christian Eriksen while bringing back Belgian central defender Jan Vertonghen for his first start since injuring an ankle last month. We had to recover the right feeling after two defeats, said Pochettino. We had to believe in the way we work and play and that is what is importaant. We had lost that a little bit. Kane said the margin should have been bigger. We played very well and probably should have had a few more goals, he said. I thought the manager was going to take me off soon but fortunately I was able to sneak the third one in. Spurs, watched by Chelsea boss Antonio Conte and former Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew, started brightly with Eriksen set up by a neat header on by Alli forcing Marcus Bettinelli into a fine save in the fifth minute.
