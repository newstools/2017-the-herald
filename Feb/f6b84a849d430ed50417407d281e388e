Bishop B. Manjoro Dunamis Today I will talk to you about God s presence. In this year of restoration His presence should be restored to your life!You see there is the presence of God that you can really feel though you cannot touch it. You still feel that there is a supernatural presence of God. Also the presence of God can be silent and it might appear like He is not around, but He will be present.Either way, the presence of God is important one s life.Take note that it s important not only in your life but can also touch your family in a special way.Your child can be preserved and spared from a deadly accident because of the presence of God upon your life. O hallelujah!In 2 Samuel 6, we see King David taking 30 000 men to go and collect the ark of God.In those days, the ark of God represented the presence of God.Unlike Saul who did not care to take the ark to Jerusalem, David says, he could not continue to rule without the ark of God- that is, without the presence of God.However, they put the ark of God on the cart, and when the oxen shook it, it appeared like it was going to fall and Uzzah tried to support it.This angered God, because He didn t need that support, thus Uzzah died there.Don t operate in the flesh, you will mess up things; serve Him in spirit and in truth.Thus David abandoned this mission because he was afraid and he left the ark of God at the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite where our story is.Do you know what happened?Since the ark of God had the presence of God, the LORD blessed Obed-Edom and his entire household.In just three months the man prospered in an amazing way and his whole family.Looking in today s world we could say his cattle were now having two or three calves; his goats breeding three or four kids at a go and his chicken probably 50 to 80 chicks.His children moved from last in class to first.His businesses from being the worst to the best!His marriage became a wonder and a desire for many.In just three months in the presence of God it was enough for people to notice significant and supernatural prosperity in the household of Obed-Edom.What happened to Obed-Edom can also occur to us. When the presence of God is in your house, things will never be the same again.The presence of God brings blessing not only to you but to your spouse, kids and even relatives.The presence of God turns the dry ground into an evergreen garden.The presence of God turns a struggling company into a profitable one.The presence of God unties things that were blocking your progress.The presence of God brings peace, love and joy in your family.The presence of God brings success in everything that you touch. The presence of God enables your hands, mind and spirit to be fruitful.The presence of God soothes tight situations in your life.The presence of God breaks and dissolves the curses declared in your life.The presence of God changes your cry into laughter.The presence of God prospers you at your workplace.The presence of God heals and restores your broken and torn heart; piece by piece it touches and heals even the bleeding inside! O I love the presence of God!Also note that the presence of God comes with the miracle of multiplication.Jesus at one time fed over 5000 men excluding women and children from a lunch box with five loaves and two fishes.Can you imagine?This teaches us that the presence of God multiply resources.I always teach that when the glory of God is with your money, you can achieve greater things compared to those with more money than you. Indeed, even what happened with the five loaves can also occur to you in a different way.You might wonder how the 2kg of sugar had served your family for a month or two.When the presence of God is in your household it works the miracle of multiplication in different ways.The presence of God brings divine protection.We see Satan complaining to God that there is nothing he could do to Job because God put a hedge around him and his household.This teaches us the when the presence of God is in your house, he protects you, family, business and your interests.Don t worry when your children are travelling from school to home; trust His presence to protect them! For with God all things are possible Mark 10: 27.
