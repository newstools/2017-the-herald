LONDON. Non-league Lincoln City and third-tier Millwall struck late, late winners as Burnley and English Premier League soccer champions Leicester City were humbled on a historic day in the FA Cup on Saturday. Sean Raggett scored an 89th-minute header as Lincoln, who reside in the fifth-tier National League, stunned Burnley 1-0 in the fifth round in one of the competition s biggest upsets.Ten-man Millwall, seventh in League One, claimed a third top-flight scalp in this season s tournament by dramatically sinking ailing Leicester 1-0 via a 90th-minute goal by Shaun Cummings. I m lost for words. It s mad. I can t believe it! Lincoln s match-winner Raggett (23) told BT Sport. Crazy. A non-league side in the quarterfinals, in modern football. It s unheard of. Second-half goals by Pedro and Diego Costa earned Premier League leaders Chelsea a 2-0 win at second-tier Wolverhampton Wanderers, conquerors of Liverpool in the previous round.But Pep Guardiola s Manchester City face an unwanted replay after drawing 0-0 at Championship high-fliers Huddersfield Town, three days out from their Champions League last 16 showdown with Monaco. It is not frustrating, Guardiola said. It was a tough game against one of the best teams in the Championship. Eighty-one places below Burnley in the English football pyramid, Lincoln prevailed at Turf Moor when centre-back Raggett squeezed a header over the line following a late corner. AFP.
