Tendai Rupapa Senior Court Reporter A suspected fraudster allegedly connived with police officers to repossess a vehicle which had been seized as an exhibit pending finalisation of a fraud case, without the knowledge of the owner. The vehicle &#8211; a Nissan Hardbody &#8211; was impounded as an exhibit after a fraud case was opened against Persuade Kaseke, a car dealer who had allegedly sold the vehicle to a Harare man, Wonder Ropa, for $3 600.It is alleged that Kaseke connived with police officers to close the case and later repossessed the vehicle without Ropa s knowledge.Kaseke is also accused of defrauding Blessing Madanhe of his vehicle &#8211; a Mercedes-Benz. He recently appeared in court facing two counts of fraud and theft of trust property involving $10 600.Appearing for the State, Miss Audrey Chogumaira, who remanded him out on bail to March 3, alleged that sometime in November last year, Kaseke sold a Nissan Hardbody to Ropa who paid in full.A month later on December 20, Ropa was approached by two policemen who were in the company of Kaseke and an unidentified man.It is alleged his vehicle was impounded and Ropa was told that it would be held as an exhibit in a case of fraud which was reported in Kwekwe but did not involve Ropa.The vehicle was taken to Southerton Vehicle Theft Squad for safekeeping pending finalisation of the case.On January 6, Kaseke, it is alleged, connived with police in Kwekwe to close the docket for the fraud case and was subsequently given back the vehicle.Instead of returning the vehicle to Ropa, Kaseke started using it but luck ran out on him when he was spotted by Ropa driving the vehicle.On the second charge, Kaseke reportedly sold a Benz to Madanhe for $7 000 and he was paid $5 500, leaving a balance of $1 500.Later on Madanhe discovered that the vehicle had faults and he returned it to Kaseke to fix the defects and subsequently return the vehicle to him.Kaseke reportedly sold the vehicle to someone else and converted the money to his personal use.
