ARUSHA. At least 168 people, 28 of them women, have been arrested in Tanzania s capital Dodoma in connection with narcotic drugs, authorities said on Wednesday. Christina Mndeme, Dodoma District Commissioner said that the suspects were arrested in different locations across the city for the past two weeks when the countrywide narcotic drugs crackdown started.She disclosed that those arrested are currently in police custody, as they wait for the investigation before being taken to court.According to Mdeme, most of the suspects were found in possession of khat, marijuana and cocaine.The official named hot spots for illicit drugs within the municipality as Makutupora, Veyula, Msalato, Chadulu, Miyuji, Zuzu, Mbabala, and Chinangali West wards.Other areas are Madukani, Mlezi, Hazina and Airport. But she added that other spots are likely to spring up due to the expected large influx of people looking to set up residence in Dodoma as the designated new capital takes shape.The official expressed concern that with Dodoma slated to be the nation s capital and seat of government, the availability of drug dealers along its streets remains a big embarrassment.Mndeme called on local government leaders to report any cases of illicit drug trading and use, whether in public or private, in their areas of jurisdiction.She described the ongoing narcotics crackdown as real and of a national nature. My request to you is to intensify the war on illicit drugs since this war is not for the police alone. Please use all the weapons at your disposal to end the problem in your areas, she added.District police spokesman Daniel Shilah urged the general public to come forward and promptly report such cases as they occur.
