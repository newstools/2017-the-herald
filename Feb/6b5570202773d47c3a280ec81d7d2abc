Tatenda Gono Correspondent The advent of technology has greatly influenced communication with society becoming dependent on social media for the spread and exchange of information. Social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have become the favourite of many, cutting across age barriers.The world is fast becoming a global village where information is exchanged in the blink of an eye, regardless of geographical locations.The country has been making tremendous efforts to be part of the global village through digitisation as well as embracing information communication technology.However, these modern trends are yet to be part of the peri-urban and rural population that defines the greater chunk of Zimbabwe s population.Most people, those who have not migrated to the urban cities in search of employment and other modern amenities, are farmers and indigenous people who have found homes in resettlement areas after the Government availed land to the masses for farming and agricultural production.In these communities, modern media trends are not as popular as they are in the urban societies, with the trends being described as zvechirungu or for the urban people.Word of mouth, township or growth point gossip is more popular and effective in information dissemination.Ward chairmen or councillors or headmen or any influential figure within the society can effectively call for meetings when the need arises to pass on information, have discussions on burning issues pertaining to the various wards or constituencies they reside in.Such arrangements are more relied on and at these gatherings or meetings, the public sphere is formed, where issues are debated and resolutions made.Despite efforts by Government towards rural electrification to facilitate access to electricity by most citizens, the availability of electricity in parts of the country has been slow.Most rural households rely on solar energy for household lighting. As such, it is the radio that becomes the reliable source of information and entertainment as most radio pieces operate on battery power.Community involvement has been key to realising political, economic and social development.Government has been initiating different programmes to make sure the populace has better livelihoods.Some of these programmes call for wide stakeholder consultations and public awareness campaigns.In essence, the operation of community radio stations gives citizens the opportunity and leverage to participate and contribute towards common interests.Community radios can act as a public sphere that brings people together to debate and reach consensus over developmental issues.These are platforms that initiate debate, which are in line with constituency needs, demands, provisions and capacities. From such programmes, Government has the ability to cater for different constituencies with regard to particular needs.In the same vein, Government or relevant stakeholders can easily communicate and give feedback to these constituencies through the same channels by which such issues were raised.Community radio stations become a platform where there is engagement of citizens on issues relative to the growth and development of their communities.The use of different vernacular languages also makes it easy for communities to communicate in a language that people can relate to.It is imperative that the Government engages public participation on platforms that are closer to the communities so as to draw closer to the populace, as well as access feedback through initiatives that are grassroots driven.With constant monitoring and operating under regulatory framework, community radio stations have the power to unite communities and enable positive developmental change.These can further create employment within various communities, provide for marketing of different products and or services, tourist attractions and different opportunities offered by different sectors.It becomes easy to incorporate what each community has to offer and how best each can contribute towards social, political and economic development.
