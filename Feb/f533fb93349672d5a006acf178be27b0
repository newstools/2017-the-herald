Yvonne Mutava Tobacco farmers are encouraged to make all necessary preparations as the 2017 marketing season draws close. Growers should take note that bookings will be starting on March 1, 2017 and deliveries to selling points beginning on March 6, 2017. The actual selling of tobacco commences on March 15, 2017.Therefore, it is prudent for growers of the golden leaf to familiarise themselves with the selling procedures.Firstly, tobacco growers producing for auction will be required to sell their entire produce through an auction floor of their choice.The three licensed floors for 2017 tobacco marketing season are Boka Tobacco Floor (BTF), Tobacco Sales Floor (TSF) and Premier Tobacco Floor (PTF).The practice of deliver today and sell tomorrow will apply at all auction floors.This implies that booking a date in the booking and delivery system means that sales will be held on the following day and growers will not be able to deliver before making the requisite booking.Growers will be allowed to re-book (whether they have delivered or not) for the next available day.The previous allowances for block allocations or space reservations will not be available this season and the booking system will operate for the full season.Bookings will be recorded by grower s registration number and each of the floors will be responsible for administering and controlling bookings made to their floor. This should be done in accordance with the procedures set out by the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB).Tobacco laid for sale without a valid TIMB registration or booking will attract a fine payable by the floor.Additionally, any purchases or sales of tobacco outside the agreed framework will also attract a fine.All authorised selling points are linked to the TIMB booking and registration system and are also on the e-marketing platform.Growers are encouraged to present for sale, tobacco that is neatly packed as possible in order to maximize revenue.As a result, tied leaf, straight laid loose leaf, clean graded strips or clean graded scrap are forms that a grower should not mix.There are specific types of bales which are expected to be on sale, for instance the minimum bale mass must be 20 kilogrammes and the maximum bale size 120 kilogrammes whereas the maximum bale s dimensions are 61 cm * 86 cm * 61 cm.Overweight, underweight and bales whose dimensions are in excess of the given are cautioned that such bales will be closed prior to sale and returned to the grower or his agent for re-baling.Growers are also reminded that the required butt size should be 25-28mm as oversize butts may be rejected on appeal.Tobacco leaves under 18cm in length may be baled as loose leaf and very low stalk types may be difficult to straight lay.A grower may deliver to the auction floor or contractor a bale, which contains two bordering grades of tobacco as a split bale.The grades must be bordering with regards to group, quality, colour and style.However, only two grades may be put in a split bale, therefore splitting into three or more grades is not permissible.Bales containing differing tobacco will not be allowed to sell and will be closed up by classifiers prior to the sale.A sheet of baling paper should be used to separate the grades while no other material is to be used for separation purposes and a bale ticket marked Split should be attached at the end part of the bale.Growers and auction floors are advised that auction sales of tobacco packaged in non-prescribed Hessian wraps or paper are not permitted.It is recommended that if a grower is unhappy with any grade or price he or she has the right to appeal to the TIMB arbitrator as indicated in section 7.2 (d) of the Tobacco Industry Marketing Act.Buyers can also appeal to TIMB for a defect on a bale by tramlining the back of the ticket and write the reason for the appeal through marking the front of the ticket with the letter A for Appeal M for mould and F in the case of foreign matter.Lastly, farmers are not permitted to collect their rejected tobacco and auction floors are to make arrangements for such tobacco to be re-handled within their premises or engage licensed graders to carry out re-handling.
