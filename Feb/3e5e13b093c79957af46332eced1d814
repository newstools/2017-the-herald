SEVILLE. &#8211; In a city famous for its flamenco and religious parades, nothing captures hearts and minds in Seville more than when Real Betis and Sevilla clash in Spanish football s most passionate derby. You are Betis or Sevilla. It is an identity, like a religion, former Sevilla defender Julien Escude said. The virtue or difference that Betis-Sevilla has is that it is not just the experience of gameday, says Sevilla s sporting director Monchi. The day of the game is the icing on the cake of a derby that is lived throughout the whole year. Just four kilometres separate Sevilla s Sanchez Pizjuan stadium from Betis Benito Villamarin, where the sides meet today. It is a city divided in two. I think it is that passion and the fact everyone is wound up in the game that makes it different from others, adds Betis historian Manolo Rodriguez. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
