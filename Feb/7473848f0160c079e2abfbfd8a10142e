MANCHESTER. Sergio Aguero has reiterated his desire to stay with Manchester City and insists he has a strong relationship with Pep Guardiola.The Argentina international grabbed two goals as City twice came from behind to beat Monaco 5-3 in a sensational Champions League clash on Tuesday. It was a welcome return to form for the 28-year-old, who is back leading Guardiola s attack after injury brought an abrupt end to Gabriel Jesus impressive start at the club.Aguero briefly lost his place to Jesus, raising questions over how he fitted into Guardiola s plans and whether he had a long-term future at the club.But Aguero, who is under contract until 2020, played down speculation that his recent spell on the bench could lead to him leaving the Etihad Stadium. I ve always said I want to be here at the club, I ve always said that at the end of the season it won t be my decision, said Aguero. The truth is that with these things it s the club that handles everything, and obviously it s always my intention to stay. When asked about his relationship with Guardiola, Aguero added: The truth is we get on very well. What he wants, above everything, from all the players is that we push a little more. He s always asking me for more, more, more. Obviously it s a sacrifice I have to make, that we all have to make, and fortunately tonight it worked and we ll see if it keeps working in the next game. Aguero spent the previous three games on the substitute s bench but his two goals on Tuesday took his goal tally for the season to 20. The truth is that those things are for the manager to decide, he added. The only thing I can do is keep fighting to be able to play. Fortunately he counted on me, now I have to help the team and show what I can do. Sky Sports.
