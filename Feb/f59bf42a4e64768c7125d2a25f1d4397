Searches were conducted leading to the discovery of an assortment of goods worth thousands of dollars in import duty, said a border official who did not want to be named. The goods and the vehicles have been seized by Zimra, he said. Efforts are being made to send the three suspects to court, he said.The official said they had intensified patrols in light of an upsurge in smuggling of prohibited goods into the county through the border and other illegal crossing points along the Limpopo River.A fortnight ago, the same team intercepted two South African trucks en-route to Harare carrying a consignment of detergents worth $30 000 in import duty.The suspected owners of the contraband under-declared the goods and paid a paltry $2,910 for both trucks instead of $29 924,50.The smuggling of goods through the country s borders heightened from July last year after Government removed various commodities including food items, building materials, furniture, toiletries and cooking oil, from the open general import licence.The goods now require a permit prior to importation and travellers are allowed to bring in limited volumes once per calendar month.
