KIGALI. &#8211; African governments have been urged to consider forming alliances with other airlines across the continent to maintain a strong aviation sector.The experts attending the Aviation Africa 2017 forum that opened on Wednesday in the Rwandan capital Kigali argued that most of the continent s airlines were not strong enough to maintain a viable aviation industry on their own. Rwanda hosted the high-level aviation meeting and exhibition from February 22-23 that focuses on all aspects of the aviation industry including maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO), business aviation, defense and commercial aviation.Speaking at the meeting, Abdullah M. Al-Sayed, Founder and Chairman of Nexus Flight Operations Services, an international aviation firm, said that promotion of airlines collaboration could boost the continent s aviation sector. There is no open skies among African countries, which has limited African airlines capacity to tap into the opportunities available in the global aviation market. The air transport industry provides significant economic benefits, playing a major role in the economic transformation of Africa, he said.The Aviation Africa conference brings together 550 delegates from 58 countries including 120 airlines delegates and 56 exhibiting companies.Africa is set to be one of the fastest-growing aviation regions over the next 20 years, with annual expansion averaging at nearly 5 percent, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). &#8211; Xinhua.
