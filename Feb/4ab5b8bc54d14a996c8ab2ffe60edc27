1 Thessalonians 5 vs 11; So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing Dealing with people on a daily basis can sometimes be very depressing. The more you interact with people and listen to their different and numerous problems, the greater your anxiety. You are challenged and you get asked so many questions that you end up questioning your own sanity.Today I would like to challenge you, despite how you may be feeling or what you may be dealing with, to take time to encourage someone else. Listen to their problems and encourage them, assure them that tomorrow holds better prospects.Sometimes, all we need is someone to just listen and spur us on. It s so much easier to discourage other people, to put them down and not do anything meaningful that will ultimately impact their lives.Let today be a different day, show the world that the Lord can and He will. Encourage someone today.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For More Info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on info@thefig-tree.org; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
