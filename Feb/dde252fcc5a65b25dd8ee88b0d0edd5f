CHRISTCHURH. South Africa cricket coach Russell Domingo says star bowler Kagiso Rabada needs to be managed carefully. As a precaution, Rabada was rested for the second ODI against New Zealand in Christchurch due to a sore knee, but returned to deliver a stellar performance of 2/39, as the Proteas defeated the Black Caps in Wellington on Saturday. Rabada made headlines last week when he became the only Proteas player bought at this year s Indian Premier League (IPL) auction and was sold to the Delhi Daredevils for close to R10m.The fast bowler has had to deal with a lot of workload over the summer and still has to bowl a significant amount of overs in the upcoming Test series against New Zealand, the Champions Trophy and the England away series. Now with a lucrative IPL contract in hand, the Proteas will need to manage Rabada s busy schedule with care more than ever as they head into a busy period. Leaving a bowler of Rabada s calibre out is tough, but Domingo believes the Proteas will be able to manage the paceman s workload. AFP.
