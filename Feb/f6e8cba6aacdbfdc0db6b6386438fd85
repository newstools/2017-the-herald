PARIS. Jose Mourinho will likely ring changes again as Manchester United look to wrap up their progress to the Europa League last 16 away to Saint-Etienne tonight. A Zlatan Ibrahimovic hat-trick led them to a 3-0 victory in last week s Old Trafford first leg and barring an alarming meltdown, the English giants should comfortably see out the second leg in France.Mourinho made seven changes to his side for Sunday s FA Cup victory over Blackburn and will likely keep his squad rotating with the English League Cup final against Southampton to come this Sunday.Just juggling his team enough to keep it fresh for every match is keeping Mourinho busy.United would play at least 65 matches this season if they reached the Europa League and FA Cup finals as well as the League Cup. I have to play Saint-Etienne, I have to play the (League Cup) final, I have to play, hopefully, another game in the Europa League, I have to fight for a top-four position in the Premier League. So I have so many things to think about, the Portuguese coach said after his side beat Blackburn 2-1.St Etienne have not given up hope of causing a shock but their 2-1 defeat at Montpellier on Sunday has dragged them into a tight dog-fight in the battle to qualify for next year s Europa League, leaving them level on points with Marseille and Bordeaux, and four behind local rivals Lyon. That will likely now prove their priority. AFP.
