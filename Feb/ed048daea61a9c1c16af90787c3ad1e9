MADRID. Gareth Bale made an instant impact on his return from injury as Real Madrid extended their lead at the top of the Spanish La Liga to three points with a 2-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday night. Bale had only been on the pitch 13 minutes after three months on the sidelines due to ankle ligament damage when he swept home into the far corner seven minutes from time to round off a rapid Real counter-attack.Alvaro Morata had opened the scoring when he bulleted home Isco s cross 12 minutes before halftime.Elsewhere, Sevilla moved above Barcelona who were in action yesterday at home to Leganes into second thanks to a 2-0 win over Eibar. I was happy just to be on the pitch. To get a goal is an extra bonus and thankful to help the team and see the game off, said Bale. It s been a difficult time but when you get a reception like that it makes it all worth it. Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane made seven changes to the side that started Wednesday s 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Napoli with difficult La Liga trips to Valencia and Villarreal to come in the next week in mind.Morata was one of those handed a rare chance to start up front with Karim Benzema left out of the squad altogether.
