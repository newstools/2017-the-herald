LONDON. Leicester City goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler has warned his team that they must avoid defeat in Sevilla in the first leg of their last 16 tie tonight to have any hope of avoiding a premature exit from the Champions League soccer. Leicester finished top of their European group and conceded just one goal in their first five games, but are struggling in the Premier League, where they sit a point and a place above the relegation zone.Sevilla on the other hand are third in La Liga, behind Real Madrid and Barcelona and also boast a better European pedigree than Leicester, having won the Europa League for the past three years in a row. It s a big game, Zieler told Leicester s website. We did really well in the group stages. It s a very tough game ahead of us. Reuters.
