BANGALORE. &#8211; India captain Virat Kohli said the 75-run win against Australia in the second Test cricket was the best under his captaincy, after his side fought back to level the four-match series at 1-1 yesterday. Under Kohli, who was appointed full-time test captain in 2015, India were unbeaten in 19 Tests before they were thumped by 333 runs inside three days in the series opener against Australia in Pune.India s hopes of squaring the series looked all but dead when they were dismissed for 189 in their first innings. But the world s top-ranked side fought back to keep Australia within reach and then batted resolutely to set a testing target.Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin then picked up six wickets on the fourth day to lead India to a dramatic victory.Kohli has scored just 40 in his four innings in the series and Australia off-spinner Nathan Lyon recently said their target is the head of the snake , referring to India s batting mainstay. Till now, this is the best one definitely. It was a quite emotional game for us, quite draining as well, Kohli told reporters. Everyone got along together, we showed the team spirit, and a lot of people were talking about the head of the snake, but I think the snake did pretty well by itself, so it s not just about one individual. &#8211; Reuters.
