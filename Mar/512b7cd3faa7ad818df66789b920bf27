MIAMI. Top seed Stan Wawrinka crashed out of the Miami Open tennis tournament on Tuesday falling 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 to German young gun Alexander Zverev, who booked his first Masters 1000 quarter-final. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Kei Nishikori advanced to the quarter-finals on cue.But Wawrinka, beaten by fellow Swiss Federer in the final of Indian Wells earlier this month, looked weary as he struggled through the third set of a match played on his 32nd birthday. I had one bad game to start the second set and then it was tough for me, Wawrinka, the reigning US Open champion, said. I don t know. I completely went down physically and mentally, and also my tennis was completely out. I had no more gas. For sure it s a disappointing match. I think the level was quite up and down. We were both fighting a little bit in the first set to find good level. It was really humid, not easy to play some great tennis, he added.The 19-year-old Zverev saved four of five break points and won 75 per cent of his service points. AFP.
