Free at last: Brooklyn Beckham was spotted having fun with friends without his sling on Thursday, heading to a north London StarbucksRain, rain , rain go away. Come again another day. This was a famous song while we were growing up.According to the Meteorological Department, rains are continuing and we always remind you that you should always move around with protective wear.This week we were disturbed by the issue of some school which was affected by floods and they are waiting for some help.So, we also got the news that it is now a crime for parents to beat up their children.Umm. Interesting but is that fair though to report your parents for beating you?Anyway we will further discuss the issue in our schools section next week.Over to international news, our boy Brooklyn Beckham teams camouflage gear with a bold pink hat as he grabs coffee with friends after finally ditching his sling following painful collarbone break.According to online reports, he broke his collarbone last month in a terrifying-looking snowboarding accident and had his arm in a sling for weeks.But now Brooklyn Beckham is back out and about in London looking the picture of health after spending time relaxing in the countryside with his famous family.The 17-year-old was spotted having fun with friends without his sling on Thursday, heading to a north London Starbucks.The aspiring photographer went all out with the camouflage gear for the day, brightened up with a plain white t-shirt and a cute bubblegum pink beanie.Continually stylish like his dad, Brooklyn carried along a matching light pink rucksack.Military-style camouflage hiking boots complemented his khakis and brought the ensemble together.The teenager was spotted getting an espresso as he chatted with his friends.He tucked his hands comfortably in his pockets and looked to be killing time with pals outside the cafe, gazing around as he waited.Brooklyn recently uploaded an Instagram video showing the moment he broke his collarbone while snowboarding during a family getaway.The video showed the oldest son of former England football captain David whizzing down the slopes in Whistler, Canada.The Beckhams eldest son headed down a run, skimming close to a small woodland drop at the edge of the piste and also went over a couple of small jumps.But it was on a wide, tamer-looking part of the slope where the accident happened as the nose of his board got caught in the snow causing him to tumble over.Hours later, after an undoubtedly painful time in hospital, he shared an image of his X-Ray displaying his collarbone ripped apart, putting him out of action for the rest of the trip.The video, which was viewed almost 400 000 times in the first four hours, was simply uploaded with the caption Broke my collarbone at the end. Well done boy.Our movie of the week is Collide .According to autobahn, the movie reminds many most of Bruno Mars song Grenade in which an adult declares he would catch a grenade, throw his head on a blade, or even jump in front of a train for someone who doesn t feel the same.For former drug dealer-turned-good-boyfriend Casey (Nicholas Hoult) the reckless devotion is not that much different: for the love of his life Juliette (Felicity Jones) and the kidney transplant she needs, Casey hijacks a truck full of cocaine-filled golf balls, pisses off a powerful German drug supplier, and soon enough has to drive really fast on the Autobahn to rescue his in-danger girlfriend, while being chased by men with big guns.Hand-in-hand with its bleeding-heart nature, Collide has the ballsy idea of making a serious action movie about a fool in love, but that just becomes one of its many bungled stunts.Despite not being screened for press (always a noteworthy footnote for a movie no matter the result) and being one of those films with a comical excess of producer tags in the beginning, the latest from gritty action director Eran Creevy starts off amicably.Huge stars Jones ( Rogue One: A Star Wars Story ) and Hoult ( Mad Max: Fury Road ) orchestrate fast chemistry as two Americans in Cologne, Germany that have a meet-cute, then a dreamy, softly-lit date-cute montage, and then a life-or-death conflict.(Their shared history of having worked multiple times with relationship-curious director Drake Doremus seems like less and less of a coincidence).Jones character, Juliette, needs a quick kidney operation that she can only get in the United States, a venture they can t afford.To make the money, Casey elects to help his old boss, a wacky Turkish drug dealer who loves 70s and 80s movies named Geran (Ben Kingsley, hilarious) steal from his supplier, the monologue-prone, super-wealthy Hagen Kahl (Anthony Hopkins).However, Collide does best when embracing its eccentricities, which ultimately come in the form of sporadic moments with Hopkins and Kingsley.If you re going to see this forgettable movie at all, come for the pretty young people but stay for the Oscar-winning actors who are doing inconsequential, character actor parts with scene-stealing carte blanche.This includes Hopkins throwing in an impression of Sylvester Stallone or Kingsley tapping back into that Iron Man 3 nuttiness.They bring in some of the dark comedy that makes Collide just a little stranger than your usual PG-13 studio venture.
