The band, which is made up of family members, was formed in 2014 and although they are popular within a certain market segment, they had not yet released an album.Fab Fusion comprises lead vocalist Faith Ganyau, her husband and guitarist Brennan Wyngard, Sergio Fenandes and Nigel Wyngard (band manager) among others.Ganyau said the album is dubbed mixed bag because of the diversity in the beats and the artistes who wrote the music.

Our music is a fusion of multiple genres, said Ganyau.Ganyau who was once a solo artiste before joining forces with her family said their coming together has strengthened the band.Speaking about the future, Ganyau said they are looking at forging partnerships with international artistes.Other artistes expected to perform at the launch are Kate Rudder, Dzidzai aka Dee Diamond, Mande Snyman, Zeena and Michela.
