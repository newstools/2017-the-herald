Novak DjokovicACAPULCO. World number two Novak Djokovic battled into the quarter-finals of the ATP Acapulco tennis event on Wednesday, rallying for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 triumph over Juan Martin del Potro. The Serbian star led a parade of the top four seeds into the last eight, with second-seeded Rafael Nadal, number three Marin Cilic and fourth-seeded defending champion Dominic Thiem all advancing.Top-seeded Djokovic, back in action this week for the first time since his shock second-round exit at the Australian Open in January, had to dig deep against former US Open champion del Potro after falling a break down in the third set.He broke back immediately to level the set at 4-4 then held at love to pile the pressure on del Potro who fended off one match point with a service winner but couldn t hold off Djokovic on the next. Every match that I ve played against delPo in the past couple of years has been very close, really enjoyable to play and great for the crowd to watch, said Djokovic. I am very happy and proud to win this match, even though I was close to losing when he was serving at 4-3 up in the third set. I just tried to get as many returns back in play as possible. The Serbian advanced to a quarter-final clash with Australia s Nick Kyrgios, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over American Donald Young.Djokovic s travails in a match lasting two hours and 38 minutes were a far cry from Nadal s comprehensive 6-1, 6-1 victory over Paolo Lorenzi.
