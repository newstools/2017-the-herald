It (the sponsorship package from Delta) is promising. But just before the AGM we should have a position so that we have something to report to the clubs, said Mubaiwa.Before the negotiations came back on track, speculation was rife that the sponsor might not renew their marriage with PSL.PSL and Delta would also have to negotiate for a package that now caters for an expanded league after the number of top-flight teams was increased to 18 following the ZIFA Assembly resolution to demote two clubs while promoting four from the regions.The PSL indaba is also set to adopt the ZIFA Congress resolution by amending the constitution when they convene. We have our AGM on March 18, initially it was scheduled for March 4, but it was brought forward, so we would do the amendments to the constitution. It is the first meeting for the year so a of lot issues would be dealt with, he said.The Dynamos boss said after the meeting, the PSL induction for new clubs should then begin in earnest.Four teams Yadah Stars, Shabanie Mine, Black Rhinos and Bantu Rovers have been promoted into the top-flight league.ZIFA require the head coach and the assistant to have CAF A licences while the goalkeepers coach is only required to have an elementary goalkeeping certificate.
