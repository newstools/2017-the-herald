LONDON. &#8211; Tyson Fury is still suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control and his license is not close to being reinstated, the organisation has confirmed, putting a substantial roadblock in his plan to return to the ring. On Monday, the former world heavyweight champion claimed he would end his exile in May. Since beating Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015, he was stripped of the IBF title, then gave up his other titles for medical reasons leading to his license being suspended by the BBBofC. My understanding is a fact &#8211; he s suspended, so that s it, BBBofC general secretary Robert Smith exclusively told Sky Sports yesterday. He s got a number of issues to consider before we even consider lifting a suspension. We ve not had any contact with Mr Fury or any of his team since he was suspended. We understand there is a hearing taking place for anti-doping, and until that matter is dealt with, the suspension will stay in place. (UK Anti-Doping) carry out all of our anti-doping issues. His BBBofC (license) is suspended until his UKAD hearing, on our behalf, has taken place. I m hoping to hear a final date shortly, within the next month or so. Mr Fury has a number of issues. It s not a matter of clicking your fingers &#8211; there are medical issues to consider, for his best interest. &#8211; Sky Sports.
