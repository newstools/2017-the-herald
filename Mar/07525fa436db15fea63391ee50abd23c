Dave Lindorff Correspondent THE so-called Deep State and Democratic Party campaign to demonise Russia for allegedly hacking the US election , and delivering the country into the hands of Donald Trump suffered a huge and probably mortal blow this week with the release by WikiLeaks of over 7 000 secret CIA documents disclosing secret CIA hacking technologies. The case being made against Russia as being the source of leaked emails of the Democratic National Committee and of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta documents that proved that the DNC had been corrupting the primary process in favour of corporatist candidate Hillary Clinton and undermining the campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and that also revealed the embarrassing contents of Clinton s highly paid secret speeches to a number of giant Wall Street banks had always been tenuous, with no hard evidence ever presented. All the intelligence agencies would say was that they had a high degree of certainty , or strong reason to believe that the Russians were the source of the deeply damaging documents late in the campaign season.Adding to doubts that Russia had actually hacked the DNC was WikiLeaks itself, which insisted that it had obtained the DNC and Podesta emails not from a hack of computers, but from an internal DNC staffer who actually pulled them off computers with a thumb drive and provided them to the organisation a person later identified as Seth Rich, who was mysteriously murdered on his way home from DNC headquarters in Washington, shot in the back at night in an unsolved case that the local police quickly labelled a botched burglary , although nothing was taken from his body by his assailant not his wallet or watch even. (WikiLeaks has offered a $20 000 reward for information that helps solve that uninvestigated case.)But one thing the blame &#8211; Russia conspiracy theorists did have going for them was their assertion that the leaked DNC documents contained routing information and ISPs that pointed to Russia as the source of the hacks.Now, however, the new CIA documents released by Wiki-Leaks the first of a much larger trove of such documents that are reportedly going to be released as WikiLeaks goes through them to remove information that might jeopardise agents or national security show that among the technologies and hacking tools that the CIA has been using to attack targeted computers, internet servers and even so-called smart appliances in people s homes, like Samsung TV sets, are a number of Russian-developed hacking programs.As the New York Times wrote in its article on the latest Wiki-Leaks document release, which it is calling Vault 7 :Another program described in the documents, named Umbrage, is a voluminous library of cyber-attack techniques that the CIA has collected from malware produced by other countries, including Russia. According to the Wiki-Leaks release, the large number of techniques allows the CIA to mask the origin of some of its attack and confuse forensic investigators.The WikiLeaks material includes lists of softward tools that the CIA uses to create exploits and malware to carry out hacking. Many of the tools are those used by developers around the world: coding languages, such as Python, and tools like Sublime Text, a program used to write code, and Git, a tool that helps developers collaborate. What this means is that current efforts by Democratic Party leaders and Deep State leakers in the government intelligence sector to pin the blame on Russia for hacking the election or for trying to help elect Trump as president, now must confront the counter-argument that the Deep State itself, in the form of the CIA, may have been behind the hacks, but is making it look like the Russians did it.Why would the CIA do that? Well, if the concern was that Trump, as he stated throughout the campaign, wanted to end US hostility towards Russia, and to develop friendly relations with that country and its leader, President Vladimir Putin, what better way to toss a spanner into such plans than to make it look like Russia had tried to corrupt the US election?That charge has been largely adopted unquestioningly by the corporate media in recent months, but it now founders on the new evidence that the CIA has the ability to pose as a Russian hacker!It looks like the campaign to portray President Trump as a Putin puppet, and to portray Russia as an evil underminer of US democracy will have to come up with another way to attack the Trump administration, and to gin up a new Cold War with Russia. The current effort will no longer pass the laugh test. Democrats seeking to undermine Trump with the US public will have to do better like maybe actually analysing the reasons for their epic election defeat, and coming up with a genuinely populist, as opposed to corporatist, program to show ordinary Americans that the party has their interests at heart, and not just the interests of rich campaign contributors.WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, the latter holed up these past four years under threat of arrest in the Equadoran Embassy in London, have done it again.Although the Deep State hasn t given up. The NY Times,, in its report this week on the WikiLeaks documents, also includes the rather lame argument by James Lewis, described as an expert on cybersecurity at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (a Washington think-tank closely linked to the US defence and intelligence establishment), that the latest WikiLeaks documents most likely were provided not by a conscience-stricken CIA whistleblower , but rather via another source. Lewis then suggests that: can a foreign state, most likely Russia, steal the documents by hacking or other means and delivered them to WikiLeaks, which may not know how they were obtained. Lewis gives no real explanation as to why a Russian hack would be more likely than a whistle-blowing CIA employee or contractor to be the source of the leaked documents provided to WikiLeaks, but the Times and its intelligence establishment sources are putting that alternative out there anyhow, clearly in an effort to keep the crumbling anti-Russia campaign afloat.It will be interesting to see how far the McCarthyite campaign to demonise Russia and to damage the Trump presidency by linking it to Russian perfidy will go, given this new information that the CIA was well-equipped to do its hacking work posing as a Russian entity. &#8211; Counterpunch.Dave Lindorff is a founding member of ThisCantBeHappening! , an online newspaper collective, and is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).
