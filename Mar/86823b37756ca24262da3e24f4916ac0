LONDON. &#8211; Mauricio Pochettino has warned Chelsea that Harry Kane s unquenchable thirst for goals will keep Tottenham hot on the leaders heels as the English Premier League soccer title race gathers pace. Kane struck twice as Pochettino s side closed the gap on English Premier League leaders Chelsea to seven points with a 3-2 win over Everton at White Hart Lane on Sunday.Having taken his goal tally for the season to 24 in 28 appearances, Kane expressed disappointment he hadn t managed a fourth hat-trick in his last 10 games. Kane s ruthless attitude mirrors Pochettino s own steely desire for success, so it was no surprise to hear the Spurs boss outline his plan for overhauling Chelsea. I m a little disappointed with the way we finished, but we dominated for a long time against a team with very good players, he said. The most important thing is to show on the pitch that we believe. Today we showed that. It s better than talking about it. We need to be there. It s not up to us of course, but if we keep going in this way maybe we will achieve our goal in the end if Chelsea fail. &#8211; AFP.
