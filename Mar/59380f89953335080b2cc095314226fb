Walter Muchinguri Property Reporter Sunway City (Pvt) Ltd has stepped up the process of opening up more serviced industrial land in its integrated park following its designation as a Special Economic Zone. The company s marketing executive Takesure Chimenya said they have been receiving a lot of inquiries as a result of the park s reclassification. The Government has designated Sunway City to be the pilot SEZ project in the country. As a result of this potential foreign investors, particularly from China, have visited Sunway City and expressed interest in partnering the company to develop the High Tech Park and ancillary facilities to house international and local companies in software engineering, ICT, internet service provision, mobile technology, research and development, solar technology, call centres, e-health, etc. Generally, demand for industrial land especially for greenfield projects has also been on the increase following the promotion of Sunway City as a designated Special Economic Zone, he said.Mr Chimenya said while there has been a lot of interest in the industrial park the company was exploring a number of tactics to attract new investors in the park. The company has largely used a targeted approach to attract investors and potential clients to the Park. This approach has focused on embassies, local investment promotion entities like the Zimbabwe Investment Authority, corporate investors, regional and international finance institutions and individuals alike. Also, traditional promotional tools like participation at local and international trade shows, advertising and printed promotional materials have been distributed to potential clients, he said.There are currently 13 Companies that are already operating in the Industrial Park.These include the National Oil and Infrastructure Company of Zimbabwe, Pretoria Portland Cement, Chemplex Animal and Public Health and Sakunda Energy.The Sunway City project is ideally located close to the Harare Central Business District and Harare International Airport, along the Beira Corridor and close to major regional cities such as Windhoek, Maputo, Pretoria, Gaborone, Lilongwe, Beira and Lusaka.
