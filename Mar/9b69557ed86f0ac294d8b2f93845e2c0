The modern PSL came into existence in 1992 and the league s bosses are planning to celebrate the milestone in style, in partnership with their sponsors Delta Beverages.The tone for the celebrations was put in motion yesterday with the launch of the Castle Lager Super Cup to feature the winners of the league and the knockout Chibuku Super Cup as one of the major highlights.Ndebele yesterday said the league has evolved courtesy of the hard work of players, administrators and corporates, who also need to be recognised. The Premier Soccer League is celebrating its 25 years of existence and we would like to have a number of activities to mark the milestone. We already have a commemorative logo in place and this will be seen on all the club uniforms on one side of the sleeve. We also want to take the time to remember and celebrate the legends of the game who kept us entertained between 1992 and 2017. So we are celebrating the achievements, the excitement and all that has taken the game to be where it is today. We are talking of the players, administrators and other stakeholders who played a big role in this. As you have just witnessed, our sponsors have shown that they are interested in the milestone. We will be sitting down with them to synchronise the activities, said Ndebele.The league has had its ups and downs during the 25-year journey, but crucially, it has managed to stay afloat.Ndebele paid tribute to their current sponsors Delta Beverages for their support to football.Former Warriors striker Wilfred Mugeyi was the first to win the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League Player of the Year Award when the league was formed in 1992, following a trailblazing season with Black Aces, who were also the inaugural champions of the modern Premiership.So far 23 different players have won the Soccer Star of the Year Award.There has also been other outstanding players like Agent Sawu, Stewart Murisa, Tauya Murewa, Cephas Chimedza, Memory Mucherahohwa, Dazzy Kapenya and Joseph Kamwendo, who was the only foreign player to be crowned Soccer Star in Zimbabwe.The likes of Zenzo Moyo, Alois Bunjira, Norman Maroto, Nyasha Mushekwi, Evans Chikwaikwai and Zambian import Chewe Mulenga banged in the goals and they won the Golden Boot with 20-plus goals, something which is rare these days.The traditional big three Dynamos, Highlanders and CAPS United have dominated the competition.DeMbare are the most successful team with eight championship titles since 1992, while Highlanders are second with six and CAPS United have four.Delta Beverages have been the title sponsors since 2011 through their Castle Lager brand.In 2014, they reintroduced the Chibuku Super Cup, an all-inclusive knockout tournament that will see 18 teams participating this year.
