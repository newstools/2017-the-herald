Jacob ZumaCAPE TOWN. &#8211; Amid a surge in racism, the South African government is finalising the National Action Plan against Racism and Related Intolerances, President Jacob Zuma said on Tuesday. This plan will give further clarity and guidance to the government and to the broader South African society on the fight against racism and related intolerances, Zuma said at a rally to mark the Human Rights Day in King William s Town, Eastern Cape Province.On March 21, 1960, a total of 69 people were shot dead and scores injured by the apartheid police during a peaceful march demanding free movement in Sharpeville, Gauteng Province, an incident that shocked the whole world. In 1994 when apartheid was brought to an end, the South African government declared March 21 as the Human Rights Day.The theme of the day this year is Unity in Action in Advancing Human Rights. Sadly, the ideology of racism remains firmly entrenched among some in our population, and it represents one of the most despicable human rights violations, the president said. This Bill is a perfect illustration of the seriousness with which we view hate crimes in our country, Zuma said.South Africans mark Human Rights Day each year for important reasons, he said. We come from a history where there was a scant regard for fundamental human rights. It is most fitting that we pause annually, and remember the past so as to learn from it and never repeat its wrongs, Zuma added. &#8211; Xinhua.
