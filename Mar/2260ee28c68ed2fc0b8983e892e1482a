Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter AS the Bonaqua Troutbeck ATU Triathlon African Cup draws closer, Triathlon Zimbabwe president Rick Fulton says they are happy the event has managed to last the distance on the continent with this year s edition marking its 10th anniversary. The event will be staged at Troutbeck Resort on April 1 and it runs concurrently with the Zimbabwe National Championships.This is the first year that Bonaqua, another Coca-Cola brand, have been the title sponsor.Previously it was Schweppes.Coca-Cola, as the partner brand, has been involved for four years.Speaking at a media workshop in Harare organised by the association and the sponsors on Wednesday, Fulton attributed the success of the event to the various stakeholders involved in the organisation and running of the event. I would like to say this is now the 10th anniversary of the Troutbeck triathlon. So it s a milestone for us. I can assure you that there are no other races in triathlon on the African continent that have been going long as Troutbeck. Ours has survived in all those years since 2007 and it s a proof of the magnificent support of a whole bunch of people who made this happen and they are partners, volunteers and obviously our sponsors over the years. So this is a big deal to us, said Fulton.The national association is this year introducing aquathlon in addition to the Troutbeck mile-open water swim event.The new event incorporates run-swim-run as one continuous event for teams and also individuals and the course is a 2.25km run, 375m swim, 2.25km run. The mile-open water swim is 750m and 1 500m.The 2016 winners for the ATU Triathlon African Cup were Ayan Beisenbayev of Kazakhstan in the elite men s event and Fabienne St Louis of Mauritius in the elite women.However, for this year, Fulton said the numbers for the elite athletes is likely to drop since it is the beginning of a new Olympic cycle. I don t think it s going to be as big as we have had in the previous years because it s the beginning of a whole new Olympic cycle. So a lot of national federations and international federations who usually fund their athletes to come here are starting that process of finding out which athletes they can back and get behind and support.The elite field is still to be confirmed as these entries are facilitated through the International Triathlon Union but the national association is expecting athletes from Japan, South Africa and Namibia.The elite will do a 1 500m swim, 40km cycle followed by a 10km run.The workshop saw Fulton taking the participants through the history of the sport, the rules and the work that is put in by the athletes, among other things, while the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee president, Admire Masenda, spoke on the importance of triathlon, sponsorship and media relations.And he emphasised the importance of partnerships between sponsors and sport as well as the need for the media to play its role in changing the mindset of the country towards sport.Schweppes marketing and public affairs director, Unaiswi Nyikadzino, said it is the passion and good governance that have seen them working with Triathlon Zimbabwe over the years.Race DistancesElite/standard distance adults (20-65 years): 1 500m swim, 40km cycle, 10km run.Sprint (half standard) distance (20-65 years): 720m swim, 20km cycle, 5km run.Juniors (U-17/U-19)): 750 swim, 20km, 5km run.Super Sprint (quarter standard) distance Youth (U-13/U-15): 375 swim, 10km cycle, 2.5km run.
