Tafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion talk 263 Good to be back for another fashionable weekend and women continue to be the subject. Yes, with fashion, women should look like women.A piece of cardboard has no sexuality.Famous fashion icon Sophia Loren, once said, A woman s dress should be a like a barbed-wire fence: serving its purpose without obstructing the view .I always like to start my weekend with quotes not only that I love them but they motivate me and inspire me to be better and challenge for the best.Last Saturday night was a big occasion for actors at the South African Film and Television Awards and celebrities sparkled like stars.Dubbed the SAFTAs, they have lived up to its billing when it comes to red carpet moments.Let me just say apart from Nigerians, South Africans, knows what it means to be on spotlight, showbizz when it is about fashion.No matter how big a celebrity s profile is, their aim when choosing an outfit for the red carpet look should be no less than perfect.Trust me, attending prestigious ceremonies or events looking like a Disney princess or an ice-cream cart, is the fastest way to send your big profile into recess.Although I, equally love and support all of our celebrities, I couldn t help but notice and share some of the hits and misses on the red carpet at the SAFTA Awards held at Sun City.We watched them on television, yes, too bad our local fashion police did not go but all the same we still have license to critique the fashion ramp.And since it s women s month let me just focus on the best and worst.My best dressed goes to Bonang Matheba.Well, she is not called Queen B for nothing.Hail Bonang, I think fashion was invented because of you.Bonang just taught many women how to rock an embellished dress, by the way the sheer rear view style is the in-thing. Unlike some people, Bonang made sure that her dress doesn t look like it has been stuck on with a glue gun.She slayed and glamorised the red carpet.I am not sure about the tie back hairdo although it is her favourite but to me it is more like a bridezilla style.Worst dress goes to Busi Mtshali.Ok, can I get some formation here, Beyonce roll up or hold up here.Maybe it was the wrong event for Mtshali, but one thing she should always keep in mind is that; bright colours are generally difficult to pull off at night, and unfortunately, those embellishments kind of did look like they could fall off quite easily.Other than that, the colours worked well with her skin tone and, of course, the hair.Please girl, you truly need some inspiration.One thing I like about such stars, is they take criticism serious not as offense like some of our locals celebrities if not wannabes.With fashion we are not always on the point but people are your mirror.Back to the closet, many women were so happy and inspired with last week s issue on suiting.Little did they know that they can play around or do many tricks with the suit.I hope, I won t catch you on the wrong side on the ramp and since you gave me the crown to judge, I won t hesitate to fix it.This week we focusing on the colour brown.A lot of ladies has been complaining on how to wear the brown clothing.Luckily fashion blogger Rima Kh. Said brown is just like any colour, you just have to mix and match it correctly.Here is a quick guide on how to rock the colour brown with another colour:Brown with OrangeThis is one of the comfiest and most charming colour combo you can opt for.Being a bright and energetic shade, orange complements the darker hues of chocolate brown perfectly acting as a harmonic counterbalance for it.Brown with YellowThis is by no means any less effective and energetic than the combo with orange.Compatible with all the shades of yellow from pale to sunny, brown comes like a natural soothing tone for the catchy yellow shades.Brown with BeigeThis is probably one of the most timeless pairs you can ever pick.For your top successful party looks, you can have the luxurious brown shades combined with sweet beige and get the memorable looks you ve always wanted to have.Beige is one of the shades, which never gets old-fashioned, so choosing this pair is always a good idea.Brown with WhiteGoing on with the array of timeless suggestions, we can also mention the brown with pure white pair, which is just another chic and classy duo for you best looks.Brown with RedLike it is in case of any combination including the red shade, brown with red combo is one of the most daring and bold versions for matching brown.Of course, you can t use this combo for a business meeting, but this is an irreplaceable option for your casual and party looks, able to add some personality and statement to your look.Brown with BlueFor fresh and creative looks, you may also experiment with the duo of blue with brown, having the most charming and sky touching looks as a result of matching the diverse cute shades of blue with the chocolate tones of brown.

Brown shades marvellously sooth the pink hues, at the same time not letting them go childish.Brown with BrownFinally, here we come to the most natural and cool pair being the brown matched with itself.There is though something to be cautious about it.It s not overusing the proportions of the same tone, to avoid which you can use different tones of brown, or spice it up with some black details.So these were the basic play pairs you can create with the brown shade. For summing up we can also note that this shade is also highly compatible with jeans, including all of its varieties, and when thinking over suitable combinations for a brown top, don t forget to consider the jeans, too.I hope we have closed that chapter on browning, unless if there is one lady with no matching mentioned colours, then brown is not for you. I suggest you stick it on to make up or to hair but hell no there is blonde.
