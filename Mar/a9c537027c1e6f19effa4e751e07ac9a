His side closed the gap to 10 points behind the leaders, who they lost at home to earlier this season, while they have also drawn five games at home in total to give them the worst home record of all the teams in the top-five.City do, however, have the best away record in the league and Guardiola says they must focus on improving their home form. Our results away are much better than at home maybe next season will be the opposite, you never can control that, he told a news conference. ESPN.
