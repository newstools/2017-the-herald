The trials will start at 9am and will go on throughout the day and we are hoping to get some fresh talent that will play for our club this year, the club director Phil Makekela said. Our club has already produced a number of good players like Nelson Chadya (Ngezi Platinum), Wellington Taderera (Shabanie Mine), Tinotenda Majanda and twins Fadrick and Fredrick Muza (Mutare City), Chris Saithomas (United States), Fabrice Ahoka (Lusaka City), Kuda Kumwala (Harare City) and Tino Rodwell Mhlanga (Triangle). We believe we can produce more players who can make a mark not only in Zimbabwe, but across the world and we offer them the right environment for that nurturing and that is why we expect a lot of players at our trials. The players have to be Under 23 years because we are an academy that wants to develop talent.
