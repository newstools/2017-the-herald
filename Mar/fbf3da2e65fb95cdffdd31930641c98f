Tapiwa Jera known as Maselo (left in picture) with Andy Muridzo sTawanda Matanhire Arts Correspondent Several producers in Zimbabwe have suffered an identity crisis and in most cases they end up reproducing their work with the same artist or other musicians. Tonight becomes a defining moment for producer Tapiwa Jera known as Maselo (left in picture) who rose to fame with Andy Muridzo s album Ngarizhambe that had several hit songs. It had songs like Dhafudhunda , Dherira , Ngarizhambe and Handina Zvipande that became popular in most public places.Muridzo launches his third album tonight at 7 Arts Theatre and it is yet to be seen if Maselo has not suffered the same fate.Will Maselo do justice to the young musician whose career is at blossoming level?That has been the question for the producer who has done nine songs on the 11-track album. Maselo is confident that the album will take the young musician to another level. We have done our best not to do the same works from the previous album. This album will definitely take the young musician to another level, he said.He has no problem with Andy working at different studios saying he was waiting to see how other producers have worked with the musician. I am also curious to see how fans will respond to the other tracks done at JP Studios and hopefully its equally good work, Maselo said. The Dherira hit maker through his manager Gift Petro said he hopes the album will take him to another level. We are launching our album and people will be judging it the following day. We have done our best to come up with unique sounds, he said.
