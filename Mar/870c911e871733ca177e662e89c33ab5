Pebble Time Apple watchCool Reloaded with Swagga T Happy cool and smart weekend!Being a teenager is a very important time in a person s life. Why? You may ask.Well, because it s the time of preparation for adulthood and that is why Yours Truly always updates you on latest trends from fashion, music to movies and as a teen you need that.Just know that Swagga T was once a teen and he too knows the walk on that bridge so don t get it twisted.The debate about parents being stopped from beating their children is still on.I know it is a crime in the United Kingdom but the biggest question is, are we ready for that doctrine and should we adopt it?Would you want to take your parents to court if they beat you up, yet they are the one who sacrificed a lot for you to be where you are right now.So you see being a teenager is very interesting.Our gadget of the week is the Pebble watch, dubbed rocking voice.Pebble is experimenting with adding Amazon s Alexa virtual assistant to its devices, confirmed sources with information on the matter.The smart watch company yesterday announced new versions of their devices: the Pebble 2, Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core.According to online reports, Pebble s CEO Eric Migicovsky noted, We are actively looking into building in a voice interface. The company suggests we could see Alexa added, via Amazon s Alexa Voice Services API, to a device like the Pebble Core.Tapping the main button would call Alexa to the forefront, allowing users to choose Spotify songs or carry out other tasks.The inclusion of Alexa could also offer similar functionality we have seen in the Amazon Echo, like dictating weather conditions or summoning an Uber.The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 are the company s latest renditions on their popular smart watch line.While the hacker-friendly Pebble Core is an obvious candidate for a virtual assistant, we could also see Alexa make its way to the new wearable devices.Both watches are equipped with microphones for voice replies.With a software update the onboard mic could be used for search queries and commands with the help of Alexa.Pebble has not confirmed exactly when we will see Amazon s Alexa assistant hit the Pebble Core or Pebble line of watches.Fans in the meantime can keep distracted with the company s new line of products.By the way it is nothing new as last year this time we wrote about it.On to our couch potato, there are a lot of movies at Ster Kinekor theatres and, this year or this season, the much anticipated-movie is Fast &amp; Furious 8 .We still got some weeks before the premi re but just know that already we stating this is a boy thing.SK has been doing girl flicks and girlfriends getaways.Please we beg you and can you dedicate this to the guys.Anyway back to the ride or die race, I am sure FF7 surprised everyone when it became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time in 2015, which obviously means an eighth instalment is on its way.And a ninth.And a tenth.The world cannot get enough of Dominic Toretto and his multi-cultural gang, who have grown from simple street racers to heist kings in a Mission: Impossible-Ocean s Eleven hybrid.According to world buzz, Fast 8 will be released worldwide on April 14.So we look forward to it and keep reloading
