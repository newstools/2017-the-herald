It is my first time to be in the Warriors camp. I do not want to say anything regarding AFCON because I hate drawing attention. I am just excited because it is everyone s wish to represent the country, he said.The keeper will compete for a first team place with high-flying CAPS United goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda and Highlanders gloves-man Ariel Sibanda in the makeshift squad.And the former Hwange goalminder said he is ready for competition. I am here to represent my country and I am looking forward to working with other goalkeepers. Whoever will be selected must do the job and we will be 100 percent behind him. It is my first call-up and I hope I will learn one or two things from the other goalkeepers, said Mhari.
