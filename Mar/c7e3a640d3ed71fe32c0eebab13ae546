BANGALORE. Shaun Marsh and Matt Renshaw posted half centuries to help Australia reach 237-6 at stumps yesterday, giving the visitors a 48-run first-innings lead over India in the second Test cricket. The Australians added 197 runs for the loss of six wickets on an intense second day, when the Indian bowlers frequently beat the edge and got variable bounce and turn.Australia resumed at 40 without loss, high on confidence after bowling India out for 189 on day one and coming off a comprehensive 333-run win in the first test at Pune.But Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin took a wicket each in a tense morning session, when India conceded just 47 runs in 29 overs and picked up the valuable top-order wickets of captain Steve Smith (8) and his deputy David Warner (33), who was beaten by a sharply turning ball and lost his off stump.
