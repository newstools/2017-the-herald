LONDON. Six years after Robert Helenius won a controversial split decision against Dereck Chisora, the two will do it again at the same arena in Helsinki, Finland, in a battle of two heavyweight boxers trying to remain relevant in a crowded weight class. The two 33-year-olds are set to meet on May 27 at Hartwell Arena in Helsinki in a 12-round bout, Team Sauerland announced on Friday.Zimbabwe-born Chisora was fighting in Helenius hometown in 2011 when many believed he was fleeced of the decision.Instead of Helenius challenging for a heavyweight title, it was Chisora (26-7, 18 knockouts) who got the nod, facing WBC champion Vitali Klitschko in his next fight and losing a decision.In fact, Chisora has gone on to face David Haye, Tyson Fury, Kubrat Pulev and most recently Dillian Whyte in a slugfest in all losing efforts, establishing himself as a gatekeeper of sorts while Helenius has fought mostly in Finland, never vying for a world title. We had a lot of fun last time, and everyone knows who really won that fight, Chisora said in a press release. He can make all the excuses he wants, but that won t help him on May 27. I feel like this is my time. I m in my prime, and I can t wait. When I get on that flight, I become a different person. Mr Nice Guy is gone. It brings the vicious side out in me, and he d better be ready. Helenius (24-1, 15 KOs) has rebounded from a sixth-round knockout by Johann Duhaupas last April to win two straight and claims he was injured before he fought Chisora in 2011. The Ring.
