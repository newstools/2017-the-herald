Hardlife ZvirekwiEddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter THE clash between CAPS United and former champions TP Mazembe could be a David versus Goliath affair but Makepekepe vice-captain Hardlife Zvirekwi yesterday declared the Zimbabwe football champions are not going to the DRC for a picnic. Many people have not given them a chance but Zvirekwi is comfortable with the underdog tag. It s a fact we are going into this match as underdogs. Obviously TP Mazembe are a good team in Africa. They have been in the African safari for quite some time now. So we accept the underdog tag but we are not going there to add numbers. We are going there to compete. Obviously we want to progress to the group stage. The hurdle ahead of us is big but I think the team is willing and are prepared to do whatever it takes to get to the group stage. We started this journey last year when we won the championship so it s a continuation. And with the way we have been preparing, I think we have what it takes to play in this competition. Obviously we are coming from the off-season but we are getting there in terms of match fitness. The coaches have been giving us the right doses for us to improve on our fitness levels. So we are ready to compete in the Champions League, said Zvirekwi.CAPS United have chartered a flight to Lubumbashi and are set to leave early Sunday morning for the assignment.They will play later in the afternoon and then return home after the match. According to the gaffer s point of view we understood where we are coming from. Obviously if you go (some days) before you would need time to adjust but if it s an in-and-out thing you will be okay.
