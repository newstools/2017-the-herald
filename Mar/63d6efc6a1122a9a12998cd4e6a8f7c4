Successful implementation of the Single Window System in Kenya has positioned Kenya as a strong logistics platform in the East Africa region in addition to providing opportunity for sharing best practices on implementation of Single Window System among peers, Wangora said.Kenya TradeNet or single window system is a web based portal and is accessible 24/7 nationwide to stakeholders in trade logistics industry and will facilitate the flow of goods in and out of Kenya s borders.The initiative is also expected to facilitate international and domestic trade at the port of Mombasa, and has been touted as the solution to the persistent delays at the port.It reduces the time it takes to process goods through customs at the port by half, from seven days to three days.The AAEC is a grouping of countries implementing the Electronic Single Window System in Africa.
