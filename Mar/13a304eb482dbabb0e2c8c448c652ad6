Margaret Matibiri Herald Reporter A Harare man who allegedly extorted $15 000 from a businessman was yesterday denied bail by a Harare magistrate. Delish Nguwaya (32) reportedly told Mr Bruce Michael Blake that he was under police investigation for spying, and that the investigations would only be stopped if he paid the said money.In denying Nguwaya bail, Ms Barbra Chimboza said he was not a proper candidate for bail considering that he has several pending cases before the court.She said that taking into consideration the investigating officer s testimony, chances of Nguwaya interfering with witnesses were high.Ms Chimboza further said that the State s case was strong and that there was overwhelming evidence since Nguwaya was arrested and found in possession of the trap money.She then remanded Nguwaya in custody and advised him to apply for bail at the High Court.Nguwaya is facing charges of extortion, possession of cocaine and contravening the Medicines and Allied Substances Control Act.The State alleges that Nguwaya was also found in possession of a prescription drug, sildenafil, that is sold under the brand name Viagra.
