Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE ZIFA Northern Region Division One leadership have invited Shamva United back into the league as a replacement for the defunct Flame Lily. Flame Lily disappeared from the radar after the Zimbabwe Prison and Correctional Services decided to remain with just two competitive football clubs. The directive saw Flame Lily and Ntabazinduna from the Southern Region being disbanded while Whawha and Tenax remain the two teams under the ZPCS family.ZIFA Northern Region chairman Willard Manyengavana confirmed the coming on board of Shamva United who are partly sponsored by Metallion Gold who also sponsor Premiership side How Mine. We are happy with the progress we are making as most of the teams have paid up their affiliation fees and we are happy to welcome back Shamva who were relegated last season after we saw it fit to give them another chance. We felt that after losing Flame Lily, we took a look at teams who would match our expectations and Shamva managed to meet all our requirements. The team was relegated, of course, but in the second half of last season they were one of the best teams and even managed to collect more points than Black Rhinos who won the championship and we took that into consideration as well. Shamva is organised and they have the capacity to run a club and we have given them a slot and they have already affiliated which shows how serious they are. They managed to fulfil all their fixtures as well as pay all the referees which is something which we expect as a region, said Manyengavana.The league will begin on April 1.A number of clubs like Harare City Cubs, Mufakose United, Trojan Mine Stars and Karoi United have come on board.
