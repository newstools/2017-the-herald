PARIS .- Former France rugby coach Philippe Saint-Andre will help train Cameroon on a voluntary basis in the African Cup in May.Saint-Andre stepped down as France coach in 2015 after a four-year period in which Les Bleus never finished higher than fourth in the Six Nations, failed to beat Wales, Ireland, New Zealand or South Africa and were humiliated at the Rugby World Cup. I m graciously lending a hand for this Africa Cup, Saint-Andre said, after a request from a Cameroonian friend.Cameroon face Nigeria in Yaounde on May 6 and Algeria a week later in what is the third level of the continental competition. There are between 15 and 18 Cameroonians who play in France between the Top 14, the Pro D2, Federale 1, 2 and even 3, the latter the equivalent to third, fourth and fifth divisions. So we ll try to pull together a team for a nice challenge: to play in front of their home crowd in their capital. Furthermore it s the federation s 20th anniversary, said the former France captain who played at Clermont and Gloucester before embarking on his coaching career. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
