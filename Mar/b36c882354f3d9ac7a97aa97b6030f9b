These balances are however sensitive to short term market dynamics, said Mr Mutandagayi.Cash and cash equivalents increased 41 percent to $78,6 million as the group adopted a cautious approach on asset placements in view of the transient nature of underlying funding.Aggregate liquidity ratio was maintained at more than 70 percent throughout the year.Life assurance funds increased by 2 percent from $27,8 million in 2015 to $28,3 million in 2016 which was reflective of a combination of an increase in the underlying business as well as the performance of supporting assets.Net underwriting income rose 4 percent to $8,80 million, short term gross premiums dropped by 8 percent due to portfolio realignment while premiums increased 6 percent on increased business.As at December 31, 2016, all ZBFH s subsidiaries, with the exception of ZB Building Society had met their minimum capital requirements in line with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe s regulations.In the outlook period, Mr Mutandagayi said removal of the financial institution from the sanctions list was a welcome development that would open it to new international business.
