Ronald PfumbidzaiGrace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter CAPS United received a major boost yesterday when defender Ronald Pfumbidzai returned to training ahead of Sunday s CAF Champions League showdown against TP Mazembe at the National Sports Stadium. The influential left-back was sidelined by injury in the reverse tie in Lubumbashi and the Green Machine were found wanting down the left side of their defence.However, the spirits of the team which were dampened by the suspension of influential midfielder Ronald Chitiyo for Sunday s match, were uplifted by the recovery of the influential defender.Pfumbidzai was injured in the 2-1 preliminary round win over Lioli of Lesotho at the National Sports Stadium three weeks ago.The tall roving wingback, who can be an arsenal in attack, missed training last week, but joined his teammates yesterday as CAPS United prepared for one of the club s biggest matches in history.The domestic champions got down to serious business yesterday as they seek to finish off the Congolese giants at the weekend.Today, the team will have another morning workout before they conclude with a gym session in the afternoon.But the Harare giants will be without midfielder Chitiyo who has accumulated two yellow cards.The former Dynamos star needlessly picked a yellow card in the match against Lioli when he was cautioned for removing his shirt as he celebrated his goal in the 2-1 victory against the Lesotho champions.Chitiyo got his second booking against TP Mazembe and automatically misses the weekend s game.Yesterday, Chitiyo told The Herald he was disappointed to be ruled out at a time he was enjoying good form. It is so disappointing to miss such a game. As a player, you want to play each and every game. I am fit and I am enjoying my game and I have a deep hunger for football right now, but there is nothing I can do because rules are rules, he said.The midfielder said he pulled off his shirt in the heat of the moment.The former Harare City midfielder has rallied his teammates to finish the job in his absence. All the players saw that it was a tough match and it is not going to be easy on Sunday, but we are the champions, we have a winning mentality and we will fight on the day. Our attitude will win the game and we will overcome, said Chitiyo.The CAPS United board will meet today to deliberate on a number of issues concerning Sunday s game.Club chief executive Cuthbert Chitima said they were expecting a very big crowd and they will, among other things, discuss gate charges. We are expecting a bumper crowd because of the result we got in DRC, we are expecting people to come in their numbers, he said.It appears the club is mulling to increase their gate charges from the $3 they normally charge for the rest of the ground ticket.But some analysts say that has a tendency to turn away fans who are battling to make ends meet.They argue that CAPS United will gain more by keeping the gate charges at $3 and attracting a lot of people to the stadium, than charging a higher entrance fee and attracting a smaller crowd.
