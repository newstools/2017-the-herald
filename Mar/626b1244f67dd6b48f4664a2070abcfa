DUNEDIN. South Africa made Kane Williamson their number one target as the battling New Zealander ensured his side prospered despite a crippling injury to Ross Taylor on day two of the first Test cricket yesterday. Williamson led a charmed life at the crease, surviving three edges and a run-out attempt to be 78 not out at stumps with New Zealand 177 for three, 131 runs behind South Africa s first innings total of 308 in Dunedin.While New Zealand were sweating on the fitness of senior batsman Taylor, who was on eight when he limped off with a calf injury, South African bowling coach Charl Langeveldt said Williamson s wicket was their chief concern. We have to try and contain Kane Williamson, definitely he s the key. AFP.
