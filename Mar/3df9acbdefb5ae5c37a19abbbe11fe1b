The total concrete silo (bulk) storage capacity is 749 500 tonnes and out of this capacity, 434 300 tonnes is usable in the current state, while 315 200 tonnes requires water proofing.Open storage space, which is hard stands storage, has capacity to hold over three million tonnes of bagged grain and all of which is usable, while shed storage capacity is 173 700 tonnes.
