Goalkeeper Tom Heaton is left wrong-footed as Wijnaldum s effort makes it way towards the back of the netAnfield. Liverpool kept their push for a top-four finish on course as Emre Can thundered home a second-half winner to complete a hard earned 2-1 Premier League comeback win over Burnley at a relieved Anfield yesterday. Jurgen Klopp s side were again out of sorts but earned their first back-to-back league wins this year to keep up the pressure on the league s leading trio.While nowhere near their scintillating best, typifying their uneven form of 2017, they displayed character to strike back after going behind to an Ashley Barnes goal after seven minutes.With the league s worst travellers Burnley dreaming of their first away win of the season, the out-of-sorts Reds were grateful to equalise just before halftime through their first shot on target from Georginio Wijnaldum.Liverpool looked short of ideas before German international Can produced a blow from seemingly nowhere just after the hour mark, bending his low 25-metre strike into the bottom corner past a despairing Tom Heaton.The victory gives Liverpool 55 points, putting them a point behind second-placed Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City and 11 adrift of leaders Chelsea.
