LONDON. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho is the right manager to get the best out of Paul Pogba, says Robert Pires, who believes the former Juventus midfielder needs time to adapt at Old Trafford. Mourinho spent 93.25m to bring Pogba to Old Trafford from Juve last summer, making the France international the most expensive acquisition in world football.However, despite the size of that transfer fee for Pogba in his debut season in the English Premier League, Pires has urged patience with the 24-year-old s form. He had a lot of pressure because some people were talking about his price tag, but you must not forget that Paul Pogba is a young player and in France we say he needs time to adapt, Pires said in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports. I think that is very important as the Premier League is very hard, difficult and tough, it is not only for the game, it is every morning in the training sessions. Sky Sports.
