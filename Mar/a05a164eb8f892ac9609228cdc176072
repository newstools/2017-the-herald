Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter Women have been given the power to run the world from fashion to music. It is a matter of chance and opportunity with the limited resources.Local fashion designer-cum- painter Tafadzwa Mukaro has released her second gospel track entitled Ndashanda .Mukaro who has made her name from visual art said she was encouraged by the response of her first single that was released last year. Though I got in to visual arts, music was in me and at one time I tried to record an album but failed because of lack of exposure. I tried to record an album when I was at Hartzell High School sometime back but then I failed because I was not exposed to it, she said.Speaking on the song, Mukaro said it captures the daily struggles experienced by ordinary people especially at their work places. The message in the song is about the day-to-day struggles experienced by people to make ends meet. With all the struggles, people must know that God sustains us by giving us strength and blessing the work of our hands, she said.She said she is comfortable working with different producers in the country to bring different products.Though she is in the other world of art, she is happy that she mastered well the dynamics of music industry. I discovered my musical talent at an early phase in life, but I never knew it would take centre stage, as it is doing right now in my life, she said.She said it was good that people have since accepted her music but bemoaned piracy saying it affects the lifestyle of several musicians.Backed by her Faith Movers band, Mukaro continues to hone her skills with live performances at functions such as weddings, church gatherings and corporate events.She is well-known for gospel hits including Mhinduro , Kupisirira Kune Zuva , Tinomurumbidza , and Munamato Unesimba .Asked if she would not abandon her visual arts to music she said she would balance the two. Art is something that comes from God and whenever you feel that you need to say something to Christians you can say it through music or paintings, she said.
