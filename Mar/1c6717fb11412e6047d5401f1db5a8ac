Walter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau Another provincial member of the fractious Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) party in Mashonaland West Province has resigned citing confusion in the political outfit. This comes amid unconfirmed reports that some active party members from the women s wing in Chinhoyi resigned from the women s executive and retraced their footsteps to the ruling zanu-pf.Interim provincial vice secretary in the Dr Joice Mujuru-led faction, Mr Tendai Musonza, tendered his resignation recently, citing confusion around rights to the party. Rival factions, with one standing in Dr Mujuru s corner and another led by Elders , who include Messrs Didymus Mutasa, Rugare Gumbo and Kudakwashe Bhasikiti, are laying claim to the name ZimPF. I cannot continue to be part of a political argument that bears no meaning to the socio-economic problems being faced by Zimbabweans at large, said Mr Musonza. I had been carried away by the false hope that ZimPF was going to be a strong and vibrant political player on the Zimbabwean political terrain. Mr Musonza has since written to be readmitted into MDC-T led by Mr Morgan Tsvangirai. He said the envisaged coalition between ZimPF and MDC-T would be dictated by Mr Tsvangirai and his party. If ever that coalition miraculously materialises, it will find me there (MDC-T) and moreover, I have gone to be part of the political party that will provide the president for the coalition because anything otherwise will be a betrayal of the people s wishes, said Mr Musonza.MDC-T and ZimPF have been haggling over the person to lead the envisaged coalition.Contacted for comment, provincial organising secretary Ms Abigail Sauti said she was not in a position to speak on the goings on in the province.Ms Sauti and other members of the provincial executive reportedly convened a meeting in Harare to announce the recall of interim provincial chairperson Ms Marian Chombo, citing inattention to the province and unilateralism.Ms Chombo could not be reached for comment.Resignations have become common place throughout the country in ZimPF, with deputy national chairperson in the women s wing and losing party candidate in Masvingo Rural District Council s Ward 12 by-election Mrs Rosiwita Madzivire resigning this week.She alleged dictatorial tendencies by Dr Mujuru.
