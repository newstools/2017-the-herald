PRAGUE. &#8211; Racially abused by their fans, Togolese soccer striker Francis Kone has taken on hero status after saving a rival goalkeeper s life in a Czech top-flight game last weekend. Half an hour into Saturday s tie pitting Bohemians 1905 Prague against Kone s FC Slovacko, Bohemians keeper Martin Berkovec sprinted towards the edge of the box to head out a long pass.He crashed into his teammate, defender Daniel Krch, who was also running after the ball at full speed.The home crowd in Prague watched in horror as the impact left the 28-year-old Berkovec unconscious on the pitch with a swallowed tongue.Swept to the ground by the tumbling keeper Slovacko striker Kone was first to provide emergency first aid as soon as he stood up. I was close because I was involved in the play, Kone said on Monday.He managed to pull out Berkovec s tongue in the time it took Bohemians medical staff to arrive at the scene after waiting for the referee to wave them onto the pitch and run some 60 metres. Seconds matter in a situation like this. If you swallow your tongue you start to choke, the flow of air into the brain stops, so you have to act as fast as possible, said Bohemians spokesman Tomas Mutinsky. If Martin is in a stable condition today, it is largely thanks to Francis, he said. I would like to thank Francis Kone for his prompt help that saved my life. Once again, THANK YOU, Berkovec wrote on Facebook. &#8211; AFP.
