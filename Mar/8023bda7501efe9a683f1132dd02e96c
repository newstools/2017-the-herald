Adele and son AngeloAdele kicked off the Oceania leg of her Adele Live tour in Perth, Australia, on Tuesday. Because the concerts in Australia and New Zealand are all being performed in stadiums, the singer planned to mix things up by adding a fireworks display to her show (during the song Set Fire to the Rain, naturally). Unfortunately, before audiences got a chance to enjoy the pyrotechnics, an incident occurred, causing her to call them off: Her 4-year-old son, Angelo, was watching the sound-check from the audience and a piece of debris hit his eye.Following the incident, Adele decided to remove the display from the Perth show, reports Australian website The Music. No serious injury was reported. Up until last night, we did have fireworks for you, Adele reportedly told the crowd. My son was watching [sound-check] in the crowd a bit of debris went in his eye, so we got rid of them. But even though she called them off for the Perth show, she isn t ruling out putting them back in for the rest of the leg. Let s get a cheer for fireworks if you want them, she asked the crowd.Based on the audience s cheers indicating that they would like fireworks at her next show, she conceded, All right, we ll do it next time. (So you re saying there s a chance?) Not only is this Adele s first time performing in a stadium on the Adele Live tour, but it s also her first time ever doing a concert in a stadium. And even though things were off to a rough start at sound-check, we re confident the rest of the tour will be great, fireworks or not. Teenvogue.
