Walter Nyamukondiwa in Gache Gache The District Development Fund has started repair work on structures damaged by incessant rains, including the dangerous Gache Gache pass, which almost cut off the fishing camp area from the rest of the country. This follows the release of an initial $60 000 by Treasury under the Emergency Roads Rehabilitation programme. At least $2 million has been approved for Mashonaland West province, which will be released in tranches over the course of the year.The pass, which is sandwiched between a mountain and a valley, had become slippery while rains were eating into the road from the valley side.Rockfalls and landslides are a common occurrence as a result of the heavy rains resulting in blockages.With a steep gradient that makes ascending and descending difficult as it spirals into the valley floor, buses and vehicles coming to collect fish were now failing to reach the area.Passengers were being dropped off on the other side of the mountain and finish part of the seven kilometres on foot.When The Herald visited the area, graders and dozers were already grading, compacting, covering eroded parts of the road and clearing landslide debris.DDF provincial manager Mr Erikano Chikande, hailed Government for responding quickly to ensure critical roads were attended to. We thank Government for disbursing funds to repair critical roads with Gache Gache being the worst affected by the heavy rains because of the 7km stretch which passes through a mountain range, said Mr Chikande. With the money, we will attend to critical situations where roads and bridges have been damaged to the extent of not being passable. Chipisa bridge on the valley floor as one approaches Gache Gache fishing camp, will also be rehabilitated.Emergency works will include a 15km stretch between Magunje and Nyangwizhu, Magunje-Chidamoyo Hospital road.Work is also being undertaken along the Lazy Y to Chiridzangoma Road, which links the farming community in Sanyati district with Arda Sanyati while the Manyewe-Bururu road in Mhondoro will also be repaired under the programme.At least 30 structures including bridges have been damaged by heavy rains this season in the province.Director in Provincial Affairs Minister Faber Chidarikire s office Mr Jim Kadziya, said the intervention was critical to assure the Gache Gache community that Government was ready to assist.
