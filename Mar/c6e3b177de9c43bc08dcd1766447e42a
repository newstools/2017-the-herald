To be part of it again, with Nick being the captain a guy I really look up to and have really followed for a while, it s going to be really special, said Weir. Nick alluded to that, how they re trying to have guys as assistants who can potentially be captains down the road. I d certainly love to be a captain sometime. I m just going to enjoy this year and this opportunity though, and if the chance came later, I d be thrilled. It s been a big part of my career and there have been some really special memories. I get along with the other assistants really well, so I m sure we re going to work well together. He expects challenges of course. When you have 12 guys on a team, not everyone is going to be playing great, Weir said. Maybe I ll be there to build up a guy s confidence because I ve been on both sides of that going into a Presidents Cup feeling really good, or other times when a captain has to build me up. If a certain player is struggling with a certain shot, I can help with those little details that may pay big dividends at crucial times.
