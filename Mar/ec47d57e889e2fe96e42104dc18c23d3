LONDON. US President Donald Trump s controversial travel ban could make it impossible for his country to host the 2026 World Cup soccer finals, FIFA president Gianni Infantino warned yesterday.The United States is the favourite to stage the expanded 48-team tournament in 2026, either on its own or as part of a joint-bid with neighbours Mexico and Canada.But with Trump seeking to ban nationals from several Muslim-majority countries, Infantino says the US may not even be in a position to submit a bid. Mr Trump is the president of the United States of America and as such of course (I have) huge respect for what he does, Infantino told reporters at London s Heathrow airport. He s in charge, together with his government, to take decisions that are best for his country. That s why he has been elected. AFP.
