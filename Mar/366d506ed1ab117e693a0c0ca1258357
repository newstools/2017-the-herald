JOHANNESBURG. &#8211; The African National Congress (ANC) and South African Communist Party (SACP) are not happy with President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Cabinet reshuffle. &#8220;We were given a list that was complete and my own view as the secretary general, I felt like this list has been developed somewhere else and it&#8217;s given to us to legitimise it,&#8221; ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe told Eyewitness News on Friday morning.&#8220;And my own view is that I&#8217;m very uncomfortable because areas where ministers do not perform have not been touched. Ministers have been moved and the majority of them were good performing ministers.&#8220;I&#8217;m very much uncomfortable with it.&#8221;Solly Mapaila, the SACP&#8217;s second deputy secretary general, told EWN they hope the reshuffle leads to change in the party.&#8220;We hope that the ANC will find a mechanism for self-correction because it&#8217;s quite clear that some of those that have shown disdain for the South African population and their office have been retained, whereas hard-working individuals have been removed.&#8221;On Friday morning a protest is expected outside the National Treasury offices in central Pretoria.
