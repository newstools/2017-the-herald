PRETORIA. &#8211; A coal truck driver s protest that caused traffic chaos in Pretoria yesterday went ahead perfectly and without incident, a spokesperson said. We didn t have any incident and everything we planned came out perfectly, Coal Transporters Forum spokesperson Mary Phadi said. Nearly 250 trucks descended on Pretoria in the morning, blocking all roads leading into the CBD as they made their way to Marabastad. Motorists had to squeeze between the 35 ton vehicles in a desperate attempt to get to their destinations.Phadi said the protest was legal and no strong-arm tactics were used to get it approved.The petite woman, dressed in an elegant African print dress, was at the centre of the protest. The male truck drivers seemed intimidated by her presence. At her instruction, the drivers refused to speak to the media. &#8211; News24.
