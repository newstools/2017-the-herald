We are happy that now our students are enjoying these art activities because they used to think that dramas and other art activities were for the lower forms. The other thing was that parents used to discourage students from taking part in such activities saying it will disturb their children from studying, The problem is not yet over. We still have those parents who are still discouraging their children and our plea is for them to allow and encourage their children to take part in these activities since we now have a number of people who are making a living out of arts, he said.He also highlighted that the pupils enjoy the art since they are given a theme and come up with their own scripts. We do not impose the scripts on them because when we do that they lose interest so we just give them a theme and they come up with their own script. What we only do is then perfect those scripts, he said.Dereck Mpofu with one of Murewa High school pupilsHe also highlighted the need for those educative dramas to be done in a way that is humorous for everyone to grasp the theme.Murewa High School, through the senior master Mr Farirai Mugadza, vowed to continue preserving the natural resources they have. We believe in preserving what we have so that future generations will also appreciate this heritage, he said.Earth Hour campaign and World Wide Fund for Nature Zimbabwe spokesperson Charity Mbirimi said they are working with two schools in Murewa to make sure that people are educated on the importance of planting fruit trees.
