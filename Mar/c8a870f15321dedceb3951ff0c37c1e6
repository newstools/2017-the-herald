Francois FillonPARIS. France s embattled presidential hopeful Francois Fillon on Monday won unanimous support from his Republicans party, putting him firmly back in the driver s seat after veteran conservative Alain Juppe rejected calls to stand in his place. The political committee, after a wide-ranging exchange, unanimously renewed its support for Francois Fillon, Senate speaker Gerard Larcher told reporters after around 20 party seniors met to evaluate the crisis sparked by the fake jobs scandal clouding Fillon s campaign.Fillon (63), had told the meeting that Juppe s definitive decision not to run confirmed that there isn t a plan B to his candidacy, according to a text of his remarks sent to AFP.With just seven weeks to go before the country goes to the polls in a two-stage vote, Fillon said: We have lost too much time with vain debates, leaving the way open for the far right and candidates on the left who are rubbing their hands over our disunity. In a sombre statement earlier Monday, Juppe (71), said he would not stand in for Fillon, whom he criticised for his defiance of the justice system and swipes at the media. AFP.
