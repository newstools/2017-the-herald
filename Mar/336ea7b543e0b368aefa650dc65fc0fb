Petros Kausiyo Deputy Sports Editor MALAWI Football Association authorities are set to convene a special meeting next week to decide on their next national coach amid growing indications that former Warriors gaffer Callisto Pasuwa has become a front-runner for the Flames job. FAM executives have been debating the appointment of a national coach and have approached their government for financial assistance to meet the package of their next senior national team coach.The Malawian have since Day One of the 2017 African Cup of Nations qualifying campaign been pursuing the possibility of luring Pasuwa to the shores of Lake Malawi.FAM officials were, however, pegged back by the fact that the former Dynamos coach, who also briefly starred for MTL Wanderers during his playing days, was committed to his ZIFA job.Such was Pasuwa s commitment to the Warriors duty that the 46-year-old mentor continued with his duties, without adequate resources and more importantly went for several months without being paid.While Pasuwa might be looking at ways of following up on his outstanding salaries, the $20 000 he is owed as Nations Cup qualification bonus and the contract fees of $15 000, the FAM officials who have been pushing for him to be appointed the next Flames coach believe now is the time to strike.Former FAM secretary-general Suzgo Nyirenda told The Herald that the process to try and lure Pasuwa started in June last year.Nyirenda, who was recently appointed deputy chief operating officer at the COSAFA headquarters in South Africa, still retains an influential role in the goings-on at FAM.
