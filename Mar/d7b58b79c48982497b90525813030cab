Mr NdlovuFarirai Machivenyika: Senior ReporterIT was business as usual at schools countrywide after teacher organisations called off a strike they had planned for yesterday, leaving shadowy opposition groups that had hoped to hijack the strike with egg on their faces. Over the weekend, the private media had also tried to set the strike agenda but the efforts came to naught as it was business as usual yesterday.The industrial action had been scheduled for yesterday as teachers demanded payment of their 2016 bonuses.Zimbabwe Teachers Association chief executive officer Mr Sifiso Ndlovu, said the strike had been called off last Friday to give negotiations that were held yesterday a chance. Apex council met on the 3rd of March 2017 and reconsidered its position on the planned demonstration following developments that promised dialogue was likely to result in the resolution of this bonus saga. In light of these developments, members are encouraged to report for duty on Monday (yesterday) and wait for the outcome of this crucial meeting, reads part of the statement posted on the Zimta Facebook page.Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe secretary-general Mr Raymond Majongwe, echoed the same sentiments. We had a meeting today (yesterday) where the bonus issue was discussed and it was agreed that bonuses would be paid in cash, so the sit-in that we had planned was suspe- nded. We will now go back to consult with our members and we will know the way forward afterwards, Mr Majongwe said.Last week, the civil servants leaders distanced themselves from pronouncements made by shadowy groups like Tajamuka and National Vendors Union of Zimbabwe that they would join the civil servants strike saying theirs was purely a labour issue that had nothing to do with opposition politics.The shadowy groups have made repeated calls for stayaways since last year, but they have been ignored by Zimbabweans.Government met civil servants representatives yesterday and agreed that the payment of bonuses would be staggered starting from April.Mrs Cecilia Alexander, the chairperson of the Apex Council an umbrella body that represents Government employees, said they had called off the strike after there were attempts to hijack their dispute with Government. We had planned to demonstrate today (yesterday) but because groups like Tajamuka wanted to hijack our issues, we called off the demon stration. Following the agreement reached with Government today (yesterday) over the bonus issue, we urge all our members to report to work today, Mrs Alexander said.&nbsp;
