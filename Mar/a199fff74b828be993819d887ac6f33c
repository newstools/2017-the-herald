He appeared before Harare provincial magistrate Mr Elisha Singano who remanded him to April 12 on $100 bail.As part of his bail conditions, Nhamburo was ordered to report every Friday at CID Commercial Crimes Unit and to reside at Plot 18 Sunridge Farm, Glendale in Mazowe.Prosecuting, Mr Sebastian Mutizirwa alleged that sometime in April 2014, Benniter Kadohwata met Nhamburo who claimed to be Adv Dinha s aide. Kadohwata expressed his desire to acquire a farm and Nhamburo assured him that he was able to assist.It is alleged that Kadohwata was assisted to get a Land and Resettlement Programme Scheme form from Concession Rural District Council and was asked to pay $200 by Nhamburo.He was ordered to pay $600 for the District Administrator, Mr Willard Masimba, ostensibly to fast-track the land allocation, it is alleged.He allegedly managed to pay $400 to Nhamburo.After three months, Kadohwata was advised that he had been allocated a 20-hectare farm at Zanado Farm in Concession.He was interested and was advised to obtain a permit before occupying the land.It is alleged that Kadohwata waited in vain for the permit and paid another $2 640 towards fuel and airtime to Nhamburo.In December 2014, he threatened to report the matter to the police and he was immediately allocated another farm in Nyandirwi.He was advised that the first farm had been allocated to someone else.Kadohwata was allegedly given fake documents and was ordered to pay another $1 000 as farm facilitation fee.The court heard that Nhamburo pestered him for a token and was given a Peugeot 405 station wagon valued at $3 000.Kadohwata made a follow-up at the District Administrator s office and discovered that the documents were fraudulent.Nhamburo became evasive and Kadohwata lost $7 500.Meanwhile, a housemaid appeared in court yesterday charged with culpable homicide after she allegedly caused the death of a minor, writes Sheillah Mapani.Vaidah Nzanga (20) appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Barbra Chimboza.She was remanded in custody to April 4.Prosecutor Mr Sebastian Mutizirwa alleged on March 13, Nzanga and the now deceased Tanaka Nathaniel Chimusaru were home in Waterfalls.Nzanga heated bath water which she left in the corridor.Chimusaru bumped into the bucket and suffered severe burns.The child was taken to Mbuya Dorcas Hospital in the suburb for treatment where she died on March 15.The body was taken to Harare for post-mortem, which confirmed that the child died from severe burns.
