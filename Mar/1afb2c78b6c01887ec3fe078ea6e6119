Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter IT S that time of the year again when netball clubs from across the country get the opportunity to check their state of preparedness for the season as they meet for the pre-season tournament today at Stodart Hall in Mbare. The event will see clubs from the Super League and the lower divisions as well as schools and tertiary institutions taking part. Zimbabwe Netball Association fixtures secretary, Agness Chiroodza, said all is in place for the one-day event with teams expected to be drawn into four pools. The tournament is on. Everything is in order and we should start in the morning. So far more than 20 teams have confirmed (their participation) but I think by the end of the day (yesterday) we will have more teams. We have all the Super League teams, the six that came for the (Division One) play-offs and then some schools and Teachers Colleges. We are going to use the pool system. And as per our plan we are expecting to have four pools, we take the top two to the quarter-finals. If we have two pools we will just go straight to the semi-finals, said Chiroodza.Chiroodza said the tournament is a platform for the Super League teams to assess their state of preparedness for the season and those promoted will have an insight of what to expect in the league. I think the tournament is going to be tough. Each and every team has recruited some players, so I think they will be at their best. This allows the teams from Division One, those that were promoted to feel the heat before the Super League starts and know what to expect and also for teams to prepare themselves. It gives coaches time to prepare for the league, said Chiroodza.There are indications the Super League is likely to start just before the end of this month and the ZINA fixtures secretary said they will have a meeting today after the tournament to finalise the number of clubs to make up the league and set the actual dates.
