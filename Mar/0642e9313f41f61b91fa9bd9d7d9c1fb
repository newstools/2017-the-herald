US dollarsCourt Correspondent The trial of a Harare woman who allegedly stole $9 400 from her ex-husband s company resumed last week, with the State producing a letter proving that the ownership wrangle of the firm was dealt with at the Supreme Court. Sinikiwe Mparutsa (46) was facing two counts of theft when she appeared at Mbare Magistrates Court.When the State led by Mr Daniel Muchimbiri sought to produce evidence that complainant in the matter was Classic Super Foods (Private) Limited and not Mr Alvin Nyaradzai Mparutsa, who is Sinikiwe s ex-husband, the presiding magistrate, Mrs Sharon Chipanga, refused to entertain him, arguing that she had already responded to the inceptions.Mr Muchimbiri made several attempts to convince the court that he was still making submissions, but to no avail, as Mrs Chipanga kept on insisting that he had finished making his submissions.After denying the State a chance to produce its evidence, Mrs Chipanga went on to give Sinikiwe s lawyer a chance to make fresh applications, before the matter was postponed to March 17.In her opposing affidavit, Sinikiwe denied stealing money from Classic Super Foods, arguing that the company was matrimonial property.Allegations are that on April 27, 2016, Sinikiwe unlawfully requested $4 000 from Custon Bonyongwe, who was a cashier at the company.The court heard that Bonyongwe gave Sinikiwe the money through a cash requisition voucher without the knowledge and authority of Mr Mparutsa, who is the company director.Mr Muchimbiri alleged that on May 30, 2016 Sinikiwe unlawfully raised a cash requisition of $5 400 from Bonyongwe and was given the money without the knowledge and authority of her ex-husband.Mr Mparutsa was allegedly prejudiced of $9 400 and nothing was recovered.Sinikiwe is also appearing in court together with her brother, Bright Chiororo (40), on two counts of fraud for which they are on $150 bail.
