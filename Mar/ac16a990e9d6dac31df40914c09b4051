LONDON. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte expects a searching examination when his side return to West Ham United s London Stadium tonight, scene of one of their four defeats this season. The match kicks-off at 10pm.Only Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have bested leaders Chelsea in the English Premier League, but Conte s men were knocked out of the League Cup by West Ham following a 2-1 loss in October.Chelsea s 10-point lead is likely to have been eroded by the time they take to the field at the former Olympic Stadium and Conte says they will have to produce a much sharper display than on their last visit. I hope so because the result wasn t good for us and we want to try to take three points, said the Italian. It will be a difficult game. We all know the difficulty of derbies, but we are preparing very well for this game, in the right way with great commitment and focus. For sure it will be a tough game and also we will know the results of the other teams, so there will be positive or negative pressure. But we are ready to play this game and try to do better than last time. Chelsea s defeat at West Ham occurred amid a run of 13 straight wins in the league and came after Conte made a number of changes to his starting XI.But with in-form winger Eden Hazard expected to shrug off a knock received in training, Chelsea will be at full strength for Monday s derby.West Ham will be without winger Michail Antonio following his dismissal in last weekend s 1-1 draw at Watford, while Angelo Ogbonna (knee) and Diafra Sakho (back) remain out.
