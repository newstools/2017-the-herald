As Harare City Queens we are excited because we were able to retain the championship of the Zimbabwe Netball Association pre-season tournament. We owe this success to hard work and the adequate preparations before the season. We had a boot camp to prepare our players psychologically and physically with the help of a sport consultant. This enabled the team to be strong and united. Secondly, we have several friendly matches as part of the preparations. Our target is to be on the top of the log. We were on position three coming straight from Division One league. This is our second year in the Super League, said Mavolwane.In the third and fourth play-offs Zimplats Ngezi dismissed Platinum Zvishavane 20-5. The tournament featured mostly Super League clubs as some of the teams that had confirmed their participation failed to turn up.ZINA fixtures secretary, Agnes Chiroodza, said the attendance was below their expectations with 12 teams taking part. However, they are happy with the quality of play they witnessed on Saturday. The teams were very competitive, they were prepared for this tournament. However, the turnout was not as we expected because most of the teams that had confirmed their participation did not come.
