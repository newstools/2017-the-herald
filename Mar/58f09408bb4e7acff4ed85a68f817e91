Some 149 200 shares in the Sarb have become available for sale.We d like to use this opportunity to diversify our shareholder base.

However, the Sarb shareholders can elect a maximum of seven non-executive directors of the board of Sarb from a list of candidates approved by a panel chaired by the governor of the Sarb. Kganyago says interested buyers should contact Investec securities.Kganyago urged South Africans to nominate experts for appointment as non-executive directors to the board, ahead of its next annual general meeting.Kganyago says the board is looking for experts with specific skills. I would like to once again encourage all members of the public to nominate candidates who have skills and experience in the mining sector, labour sector and commerce or finance sectors. He says shareholders are entitled to vote for board members. These votes are normally exercised at the annual general meeting of the Sarb and each shareholder is limited to one vote for every 200 shares held.
