LUSAKA. The death of eight people who tried to queue up to receive food aid at a sport complex in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, has raised questions on the country s food security situation, the country s leading opposition leader said on Tuesday. These deaths were avoidable in the sense that our people died as they were looking for food, which has become a luxury under the current government, Hakainde Hichilema, leader of the main opposition United Party for National Development (UPND) said.At least eight people were killed on Monday in a stampede at the Olympic Youth Development Center (OYDC) as thousands of people invaded the sports complex to receive free food hampers which were being donated by a church.The food parcels included a head of cabbage, sugar, soya pieces, cooking oil and a 10 kilogramme bag of maize-meal.The church had prepared food hampers for about 35 000 people, mostly from the slums of the city but more people turned up to receive the free food.According to eyewitnesses, the stampede was caused by impatient residents who did not have coupons but wanted to gain entry into the sports complex.The government has since expressed sadness over the loss of lives and suspended the operations of the church following the incident, claiming it did not follow laid-down laws for organising public gatherings.
