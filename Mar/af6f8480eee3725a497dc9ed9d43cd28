LIVERPOOL. &#8211; Liverpool have a fine record against the English Premier League soccer s leading sides this season, which is just about the only solace for Jurgen Klopp as he prepares for tonight s crucial clash with Arsenal. The match kicks-off at 7:30pm.The Reds 3-1 defeat at Leicester on Monday exposed significant defensive weaknesses once again as a campaign that once promised much continued to unravel.Liverpool, top of the league briefly in November, will start the weekend in fifth place, and could be sixth by kick-off, as Manchester United will move above them by beating Bournemouth in today s early game.Klopp s preferred 4-3-3 formation has been excellent against the rest of the current top six &#8211; in eight matches this season against Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United, Liverpool have won four and drawn four.However, they have fallen short against teams in the lower half of the table.Klopp has not been helped by a lack of stability in central defence, with Dejan Lovren absent for the last month with a knee injury. Midfielder Lucas Leiva was paired with Joel Matip in the centre of defence at Leicester, and proved incapable of dealing with the pace of Jamie Vardy. &#8211; AFP.
