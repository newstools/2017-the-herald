LEICESTER. &#8211; Jamie Vardy has labelled the recent criticism directed towards Leicester City as unfair after their morale-boosting English Premier League soccer victory over Liverpool, on Monday night. The reigning champions claimed their first Premier League win of 2017, hammering Liverpool 3-1 just four days after Claudio Ranieri was relieved of his duties.Vardy produced a man-of-the-match display, scoring either side of Danny Drinkwater s thunderbolt, as the champions responded to their detractors. There was a bit of apprehension going into the game, Vardy told Sky Sports. We ve come under a lot of unfair stick with the stuff that s been in the press. What you ve seen out there is a reaction from the lads, the performance showed exactly that. Now it s down to us to do that consistently moving forward and pick up as many points as possible. Asked what had changed for Leicester to produce a performance so dissimilar to the form which cost Ranieri his job, the England striker added: I can t put my finger on why we haven t seen a performance like that. We ve been working hard with everything we ve been asked to do but it has not been happening. Luckily everything clicked tonight. Vardy ended a frustrating goal-drought to score his first Premier League goals since December s 4-2 victory over Manchester City, as Leicester moved up to 15th in the table, two points clear of the bottom three. &#8211; Sky Sports.&nbsp;
