LONDON. &#8211; Zlatan Ibrahimovic will serve a three-match ban after admitting a Football Association charge of violent conduct. The Manchester United striker was charged with elbowing Tyrone Mings at Old Trafford on Saturday moments after the Bournemouth defender stood on his head. Ibrahimovic initially claimed Mings had jumped into his elbow, but he has opted against fighting the charge and will begin a domestic suspension with immediate effect.The ban deprives United of their top scorer for Monday night s FA Cup quarter-final at Chelsea and English Premier League games against Middlesbrough and West Brom. The Swede s availability for the Europa League tie against FC Rostov is unaffected.Mings was also charged in the aftermath of Saturday s 1-1 draw and has chosen to appeal, with the FA arguing his alleged offence is worth more than the standard three-match suspension.Mings said after Saturday s Premier League game at Old Trafford that the stamp was accidental, and Sky sources have confirmed the club are backing their player on that. &#8211; Sky Sports.
