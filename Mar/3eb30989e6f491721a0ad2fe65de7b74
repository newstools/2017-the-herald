MANCHESTER. &#8211; Michael Carrick would probably hang up his boots if his Manchester United contract is not extended beyond the summer. The 35-year-old midfielder is the second-longest serving player at Old Trafford &#8211; after Wayne Rooney &#8211; and his 11-year contribution will be recognised with a testimonial on June 4.The match will pit a Manchester United 2008 XI against the Michael Carrick All-Stars, a day that will raise money for charity and could also act as his farewell.Carrick s contract expires in the summer and, despite still impressing for United, would seriously consider calling time on his playing career if his deal was not extended. I ve said for some time now, as long as I feel I can contribute enough that s fine by me, he said. I understand I am not going to play every game. I haven t really got a problem with that. I need to be playing enough. I don t want to be here just for the sake of you ve been here so long, let s keep you on board. I wouldn t want to do that. It almost depends on how long I m here. I don t think there s many places I d want to play, if any, after this anyway. Asked if that would be it if no extension was forthcoming, Carrick replied: I probably would say so, yes. I think so. I couldn t say definitely but pretty much. &#8211; ESPN.
