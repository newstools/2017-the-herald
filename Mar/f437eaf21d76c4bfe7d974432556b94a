HAMILTON. New Zealand were left frustrated yesterday after rain washed out the last day s play of the final Test cricket against South Africa, denying them a series-levelling win. At the start of the day, South Africa were on the ropes at 80 for five in their second innings, still 95 runs short of making New Zealand bat again. But the rain which had disrupted part of each of the first four days fell persistently yesterday, forcing the umpires to abandon play without a ball being bowled. Obviously very frustrating, coming into the last day with a lot to play for, said New Zealand captain Kane Williamson. Saying that, we were probably quite fortunate to play as much cricket as we did in this Test. Overall, we have to look at this game as a really positive game and one that was potentially one of our best Test performances of the home summer. South Africa captain Faf du Plessis, who was unbeaten on 15, said their plan was for him to block all day while Quinton de Kock, also not out 15, chased the runs. AFP.
