ZOL CEO Denny Marandure explains the organisation s mission, which is to deliver simple and useful solutions that improve the way ZOL customers live, work and playIn a move set to benefit heavy internet users who regularly burn the midnight oil, ZOL has introduced a service called Night Owl which has been lauded by tech analysts as the best fibre deal on the market right now offering faster internet speeds at lower prices . ZOL offers three capped packages with the lowest prices, FibroniksLite, priced at $29 per month for 25GB and any new subscriber benefits from free installation, gets a free ZOL phone and free minutes to sweeten the deal.Now with Night Owl, FibroniksLite subscribers can get an extra 25GBfor $6 thus effectively doubling their data. So for $35 per month, the Lite subscribers will enjoy 50GB.The Night Owl service is available for use from 11pm to 6am, which means it is only metered between those specific hours, therefore any usage beyond 11pm to 6am, will default to the subscriber s base data.For $47 a Fibroniks Basic Essentials subscriber can enjoy 70GB of data with Night Owl, such that 1GB of data will be offered at a cost of 67 cents.Without the Night Owl service, the Basic Essential package goes for $39 per month and is capped at 35GB with speeds of up to 5Mbps.Any Fibroniks Family Essentials subscriber who signs up for Night Owl will enjoy 150GB per month at 70 cents per 1GB, if they pay the Night Owl surcharge of $16 to get an extra 75GB.Priced at $89 per month, the Fibroniks Family Essentials ordinary subscription offers 75GB and speeds of up to 10Mbps.If a subscriber exhausts his or her Night Owl data before the month ends, they will default to their base data since Night Owl data cannot be topped up.Night Owl is an opt-in service for capped subscribers who can sign up through an online sign-up sheet and begin enjoying the service from tonight.If you are not already a ZOL subscriber, the Night Owl offer is arguably one of many good reasons to become one.By introducing this night browsing service &#8211; ZOL has made night browsing affordable, faster and convenient for internet users who need to study, work, surf or stream.A simple 5-step online sign up process via www.zol.co.zw/signup means you can subscribe for Fibroniks in under 2 minutes and for as little as $29 per month.You deserve to live like this.
