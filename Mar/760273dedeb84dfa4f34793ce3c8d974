Walter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau Karoi Residents Trust chairperson Never Gasho has been arrested for undertaking an unsanctioned demonstration over alleged corruption in council. Among the grievances is the alleged failure to observe customer care by a car parking management firm engaged by council.Residents alleged that efforts to engage council and management had not yielded positive results.Gasho allegedly engaged in the demonstration at Karoi Hotel, where he was picked up by police on Monday afternoon and was only released yesterday after appearing before a magistrate.The matter will proceed by way of summons after a charge of criminal defamation raised against Gasho was struck off from the country s statutes.No comment could be obtained from the police.The residents trust is also questioning the criteria being used to recruit a substantive town secretary, saying it is shrouded in secrecy. We believe that the criteria is tailor-made to give undue advantage to a member of staff, said a resident who declined to be identified.Acting town secretary Mr Wellington Mutikani dismissed the demonstration as a one-man show whose grievances council was not aware of.
