Talent Gore Features Writer In today s global world, the challenge to maintain national unity is even greater, especially where people with drastically different backgrounds and life philosophies share the same block, church and, sometimes, same lunch-room. So how do you get along with others with whom you don t always agree? First, one must begin by accepting the fact that each person is different from the next.A person s opinion may differ greatly, even when your cultural or social circumstances are similar. And so it is important for there to be healthy conversation among different groups of people to create an understanding among them.There is no negating that the future of any country depends on the youths. Zimbabwean youths acknowledge this fact and have consistently laid claim to the nation s leadership. While one may give credence to the saying that leaders are born, not made, one must also concede that leadership in a modern society requires a certain degree of preparation and orientation beforehand.The proposed reintroduction of National Youth Service is important when we are looking beyond the present.Thinking of the future necessitated the mobilisation of certain categories of youth, through the scheme, to give them proper guidance and orientation relevant to the needs of the country.The service instils, in young Zimbabweans, a sense of national pride and inculcating patriotism in them.The programme proposes to unite people above party lines while promoting awareness of foreign influence and interference in national politics.Because of our history of resistance to colonial and imperialist domination, Zimbabwe has remained revolutionary in character.The purpose of the scheme is primarily to inculcate in Zimbabwean youths the spirit of selfless service to the community and emphasise oneness and brotherhood of all Zimbabweans irrespective of cultural or social background.President Mugabe has affirmed his confidence and trust in the programme, saying the objectives were still relevant for national development.There could be blemishes in the programme but these are not insurmountable.The advantages of the programme can, however, overshadow the complications.One should not throw away the baby with the bathwater. Whatever be the case, the scheme should be reintroduced.The National Youth Service is provided for by the Zimbabwe National Service Act of 1979, which set benchmarks on who could be incorporated into the Zimbabwe National Youth Service and the Military.The programme was suspended in 2009 due to financial constraints; Government could not sustain it anymore.The reintroduction of NYS is important to the youth because its basic goals and objectives are to attain a united, strong and self-reliant nation.It also seeks to create a great and dynamic economy for a land of bright and full opportunities for all citizens.However, if the NYS is to be re-established, Government must ensure that it is rebranded so as to have a positive impact to the youths in Zimbabwe.This would ensure that young people will willingly and fully appreciate the programme due to its inclusive nature, thus enhancing ownership and sustainability.One believes every child, as they grow up in Zimbabwe, should put the country first and their personal interests second.When children reach secondary education, they should be taught the elements of patriotism.National Youth Service is not peculiar to Zimbabwe.There exists an International Association for National Youth Service (IANYS), which is a global network of professionals working to promote youth service around the world.Nigeria s version of the NYS, for example, was launched in 1973 and was implemented to promote the ideals of national unity as well as a sense of common destiny among Nigerians.The timing of the Nigerian NYS was more aligned towards the elimination of mental suspicion and mistrust that had been brought forth by the civil war.Another example of the NYS is the Mexican model that among other things requires all university students to participate in the University Service Social programme in the last third of their academic programmes as a part of the tertiary curriculum.This programme was established by law in 1944 to involve and use university resources to meet the national goal of eliminating poverty through skills training.All medically trained professionals are required to serve in disadvantaged communities for one year before they can be licensed.In 1996, for example, recruits were given the option of either serving in the army or in one of three national service programmes involving adult literacy, social work and sports promotion.Non-governmental organisations and Government youth organisations also organised youth service projects.It is in this breath that it becomes imperative that the programme fosters a sense of nationalism, leadership development, human rights awareness and life skills for youths.To achieve this, it should be rolled out in a non-partisan and highly professional manner which would be in line with regional and international best practices.Critical stakeholders (civic society, churches and Government bodies) who interface with young people should collectively develop a curriculum for use in the training exercise.The curriculum should include constructive life skills, human rights and leadership training. This must be multi-sectoral in approach and would be rolled out in consultation with young people and youth organisations.In its implementation the training should be gender sensitive and incorporate young people living with disabilities. This would further contribute towards total participation and inclusion youths.Positive lessons can be drawn from other countries that have implemented similar programmes with successful outputs.One of the methods involves incorporating the NYS at tertiary institutions were students embark on community services with bias towards their field of study or choice.There must be a clear monitoring and evaluation mechanism that will rate the effectiveness of the programme. This will enable stakeholders to gradually alter the programme to suit the current needs of young people as it is rolled out.There is need for transparency in the selection of recruits and trainers and a clear policy on administration, implementation and monitoring and evaluation exercise of the program.President Mugabe during the 21st February Movement celebrations in Matobo said the re-introduction of the National Youth Service should help mould disciplined and well-focused youths who are productive and ready to defend their country.He further urged the youths to take advantage of the Chitepo Ideological College in Masvingo to learn more about the country s history. I hope our youths are making use of that Chitepo Ideological College in order to know the past, the foundations of our revolution as well as prepare themselves for the future; chart the road of governance tomorrow, he said.The nation needs to draw lessons from other countries such as Mexico, China and Nigeria that have implemented National Youth Service with differing successes.National Youth Service can cut across racial, cultural and political lines creating patriotic Zimbabweans dedicated to the development and success of their nation.
