LONDON. &#8211; Over the course of Chelsea s past 27 matches in all competitions, in which they have been defeated just twice, there has been much debate on how to stop Antonio Conte s juggernaut. Many tactics have been put into practice to differing degrees of success without conclusive solutions being found.The first theory was mirroring the Blues formation and deploying a three-man defence in order to directly match up against them. Such thinking was blurred, given that almost every team that tried it was using a system they were unfamiliar with against a team that practiced it regularly.Sunderland, Bournemouth, Stoke, Leicester and Hull all came unstuck in the weeks either side of the New Year, losing 1-0, 3-0, 4-2, 3-0 and 2-0 respectively.West Brom attempted something entirely different when they came to Stamford Bridge in December. Tony Pulis deployed four natural centre-backs across the defence and two holding midfielders to deny space to Chelsea s attacking quintet of Diego Costa, Eden Hazard, Pedro Rodriguez, Marcos Alonso and Victor Moses.It wasn t designed specifically with Chelsea in mind as Pulis has used it regularly before and since, but it almost worked, with the Blues requiring a late error from Gareth McAuley and ruthless opportunism from Costa to secure a 1-0 win.Although Chelsea lost 2-1 to West Ham in the EFL Cup in October, Conte had fielded a much-changed side, so the only real occasion when his first-choice team was defeated after starting with three centre-backs was in January s 2-0 reverse to Tottenham.Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino chose to match Chelsea s formation, with the difference being that his side are used to switching between defensive formations. Not only that, but he specifically targeted a perceived weakness by exploiting Cesar Azpilicueta s relative deficiency against the aerial ball together with Victor Moses defensive inexperience. &#8211; ESPN.
