Pearson Pfavayi of Zimhost.Do you feel your website is not giving you any business or not getting enough traffic despite all the advertising and marketing? Could it be because most visitors to your website are not getting the right information, getting confused or just finding it difficult to get the products and services they want?Ever thought of a live interaction between you the website admin and your website visitors.Live chat can help existing customers, new customers, and potential customers, and when leveraged properly, can drive more sales through leads.Live chat is a script or code that is installed on your existing website so as to offer live chatting between you, the website admin and your visitors. Unlike email or contact forms, live chat offers a vast number of advantages namely:Convenience As a live chat admin, you get to see the visitors navigation on your website thus you can initiate a chat or await their initiation then guide them through.You can even pin point them to the right page showcasing the product or service the visitor is enquiring about.In other words, visitors get to talk to you live during their browsing session and chances are they will buy or stay longer on your website getting to know all the different products on offer.Efficiency and competency Unlike phone calls, live chat gives you time to dig up answers from your documents or work colleagues to give the best answers to queries being raisedIncrease sales Website sales will increase because customers have someone who can immediately walk them through a sale if they become confused or have a question that can make or break a sale and this helps eliminate bounces (leaving a website without browsing) away from retail websites and ensure that full items in shopping carts make it through check out and purchases.Traffic analytics Live chat comes with analytics which shows you visitors history as in how they came to your website whether via Google search results or a referral link from another website etc. If Google search results, you can view the terms used to search and find your pages making it easy to know what they are looking for.You can even optimise such product pages based on the traffic they pull. The analytics also provides information like country location, device being used, browser and all pages being browsed through24 /7 Availability With live chat you can operate 24/7 especially if you are running businesses like safari game parks with a worldwide target market which includes countries like Australia with a time difference of about 12 hours.You surely wouldn t want visitors from such countries to believe you are closed simply because its night time on your end. A nightshift employee can cover the gap so you maximise on all potential leads.Mobile chatting Integration on android and iOS is possible implying you don t have to be tied down to your computer to chat live.You can manage all these from the palm of your hands while having drinks with friends or out camping as long as you have an internet connectionCut down expenses One employee can handle multiple concurrent chats cutting down on employee tasks associated with emails, phone calls and client visits etcSo how do you get started?
