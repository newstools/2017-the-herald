BUENOS AIRES. &#8211; The world s top-ranked football nation Argentina risk failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970 after Lionel Messi s suspension and a humiliating defeat to Bolivia. The two-time world champions woes deepened just as the Argentine Football Association (AFA) named new executives on Wednesday.They are ostensibly tasked with ending three years of turmoil in the Argentine game, but analysts said the appointments were politically influenced. The defeat by Bolivia sparked press rumors that one of the new AFA management s first moves may be to fire coach Edgardo Bauza.But it may be too late to get La Albiceleste on the plane to Russia to entertain fans across the globe at next year s World Cup.FIFA hit Argentina s star striker Messi with a four-match ban on Tuesday for swearing at an assistant referee in a game against Chile last week. Four games is outrageous. There are malicious fouls that only get a two-game ban, and this was just verbal abuse, said former Argentina coach Cesar Menotti. Argentina s World Cup hero Diego Maradona said he was ready to lead an appeal to FIFA against Messi s ban, but it is rare for the sport s governing world body to repeal a suspension. &#8211; AFP.
