John Manzongo recently in Victoria Falls Zimbabwe S image has greatly improved as witnessed by a rise in the number of tourists visiting Victoria Falls, a senior official has said. Zimbabwe Tourism Authority chief operating officer Mr Givemore Chidzidzi, in an interview said the number of tourists in Victoria Falls had sharply increased compared to previous seasons. Our tourism season normally starts later in the year, but this year we are noticing a different scenario where we continue to receive many tourists. The mix of the tourists is very impressive; there are Asians, Europeans, Indians and Americans. As one strolls in the falls rainforest you can hear different languages among the tourists such as German, French, Italian and Russian among other languages. Victoria Falls hotels, lodges and safaris continue to record brisk business and I was just talking to some safari operators who are very upbeat about February figures, which they are saying have doubled previous seasons, he said.Mr Chidzidzi added that the introduction of a bigger aircraft by South African Airways had greatly contributed to the number of tourists in the resort town. South Africa Airlines Airbus A330-200 which carried 200 passengers on its maiden flight to Victoria Falls, was full because of the demand that our destination is attracting. Mr Chidzidzi said the country needed to sort out issues that were fuelling negative publicity. The country also needs to take advantage of the tourism indaba to be held in Berlin, Germany from March 8-12 and 15 tourism operators from Zimbabwe will be participating.
