Challenges faced by communities ravaged by Cyclone Dineo-induced flooding countrywide require Government and stakeholders involved in disaster management to urgently harness available material resources and deliver them to those in need. Over and above, the more than 240 people who died of floods and other related mishaps, authorities should also be on the lookout for another disaster unfolding of people likely to succumb to water-borne diseases.We implore all stakeholders involved in humanitarian assistance to swiftly move supplies to affected communities because already there are confirmed and unconfirmed reports that scores of people are suffering from typhoid, cholera and malaria.The country should not lose life in cases that can be avoided by just moving in food and medical requirements on time.Heavy rains accompanied by severe flooding left a trail of destruction in areas such as Matabeleland North (Tsholotsho, Lupane, Nkayi, Binga, Umguza and Hwange Urban), Matabeleland South (Matobo, Umzingwane, Bulilima, Insiza, Beitbridge and Gwanda) and Midlands (Gokwe North, Gokwe and Mberengwa).Masvingo (Chivi, Mwenezi, Chiredzi, Masvingo Rural and Bikita), Mashonaland West (Kariba, Zvimba and Hurungwe, Manicaland (Mutare Rural, Mutasa, Buhera, Chipinge and Chimanimani), Mashonaland Central (Guruve and Mt Darwin), Chitungwiza and Mabvuku, Epworth, Waterfalls, Hopley and Budiriro in Harare Metropolitan province were also affected.It is against this backdrop that Zimbabwe last week launched a $200 million domestic and international appeal for humanitarian assistance for victims of flooding.At a function to launch the appeal attended by several ambassadors accredited to Zimbabwe, local business executives and senior Government officials, Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko said Government had already raised $35 million.The floods that caused massive destruction to infrastructure in affected areas, have since been declared state of disaster by President Mugabe.When disasters of such magnitude strike, assistance is mobilised from different quarters and it is incumbent upon Government to ensure that resources are not abused and each and every cent and material gets to the affected people.This calls for high levels of accountability and empathy by those given responsibility so that more donors and well-wishers continue to assist the affected people. Those caught abusing the donations should be used as examples for would-be offenders by sending them to jail.The actions of people entrusted with humanitarian assistances should be beyond reproach.There are heart-rending cases of pregnant women who are failing to access medical assistance and giving birth at home because their areas were cut off from medical facilities. Such cases need urgent intervention.People s ways of life were disrupted and there are cases of people who need urgent food supplies. Estimations are that to repair the damage infrastructure the country will need between $188 million to $200 million.Countries such as China, Japan and local mining companies among others have made tremendous contributions towards helping the affected so that life returns to normal.As we grapple to come to terms with the scale of disaster, this should also be a wake up call for the Civil Protection Unit to be always on alert to deal with cases of such nature every rainy season to minimise human suffering.On the positive side, where the rains didn t cause destruction, they have assured the nation of a good harvest so that life can fast return to normal.This is far different from the previous season when people were already grappling with the effects of drought this time around.This year God has given joy and sorrow almost in equal measure.
