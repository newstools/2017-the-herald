Some ECD centres are not teaching computers as they claimShepherd Chimururi Cool Lifestyle Correspondent Majority of Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres are short-changing their learners by not teaching them what is the in the new Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) curriculum despite advertising on their flier and making the parents pay for computer lessons. This disturbing revelation came out at a workshop on aptly titled E-learning in the new curriculum that was held in the capital last week. It was organised by Dzidzo Inhaka Audio Visual learning.About 30 teachers and directors of junior schools and ECD centres had a candid soul searching exercise that will send tongues waging in corridors of power. Except just a few, most admitted that they were indeed short changing learners by just doing make up lessons to impress parents. Displaying of computers at reception, naming of computer parts and their use, switching on and shutting down at most is what most schools are doing far short of the real computer operation recommended by the ministry of primary and secondary education.The workshop also covered integration of e-learning in other subjects. With the aid of visuals, teachers were able to understand new subjects in the curriculum like mass displays, physical education, science and discovery, sovereignty and heritage studies.In an in interview with Cool Lifestyle, Alice Fore of Sheali E-learning and ECD centre said, Most schools are taking advantage of parents who do not know what the curriculum says as a result they do not know what skills to expect from their children. The ministry must move to protect the unsuspecting parents who are being ripped off by monitoring children s computer lessons, she said.Divine Foundation Junior school director Stephen Kaseke said the workshop was just a tip of an iceberg of what is there to learn about e-learning. I now realise that if we want a new generation of people who would want our country to be world class in all spectrum of endeavours be it science, mechanical, ICT, etc, we need to embrace e-learning from ECD level.Brooklands Junior school administrator, Linda Chikodzi, also called all staff members to be well versed with e-learning. I came here to learn and understand e-learning because at school I am the point person. Parents interact with me before they know the teacher of their child so I have to give them satisfactory answers. Most parents who come to our schools come inquiring about if we are implementing e-learning according to the new curriculum. E-learning is not just for the teachers but for everyone from school staff from the director to the drivers and kitchen stuff, she said.Some of the schools represented included Woodridge group of schools, Brooklands Junior, New Look ECD, Brightest Bubbles, Rainbow Kids, 3rd World pre school, Sunrise Junior, Witrish Junior, Creative Kids, Nyachuru primary, Little Minds ECD, Gabrielle Junior, Divine Foundation Junior, Loving Arms Pre school, Greatest beginnings ECD, Classic Kids, among others.Dzidzo Inhaka brand ambassador Trish Manongwa (9) and Melissa Nyawaranda aged five years of Sheali E-learning and ECD centre in Chitungwiza did practical computer demonstrations to ensure teachers would see and believe in practical implementation of the new ICT curriculum.In an effort to spread the e-learning gospel Dzidzo Inhaka is going to hold workshop in Bulawayo on March 25 before heading to Mutare on March 28where more than 50 schools have already registered to participate.The Dzidzo Inhaka team has also engaged popular dancehall artist Seh Calaz to do an e-learning themed song entitled E-learning irikubvira to be released in two weeks.
