He managed only one win, against Slovakia s Martin Klizan, before losing to Kyrgios, who will meet big-serving American Sam Querrey for a place in the final.Nadal bounced back from a break down in both sets to defeat Nishioka 7-6 (7/2), 6-3.The second-seeded Spaniard, a two-time winner in Acapulco, hammered five aces and won 81 percent of his first-serve points in the battle between the two lefthanders. He is so quick, Nadal said. I felt I needed to choose the right shots to do the damage. I was trying to hit the winner too early sometimes and too late other times, so it was tough to get my rhythm. &#8211; AFP.
