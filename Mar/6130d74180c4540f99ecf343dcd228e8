Jose MourinhoMANCHESTER. &#8211; Jose Mourinho says Manchester United have as much chance of cracking a safe as signing Neymar from Barcelona. The Brazil international last week revealed a love of English Premier League football and said any player would like to work with Mourinho or Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.But Barcelona tied the forward to a five-year contract in October, and a release clause starting at 181m increases incrementally over the course of his deal.Asked about a possible Manchester United move for Neymar, Mourinho told ESPN: It s speculation. I always try to be objective and pragmatic with clubs and to ask them what they can give me. To ask for Neymar is absurd. A club like Barcelona cannot and will not lose Neymar. Although Lionel Messi is still a young player with years ahead of him, he s almost 30, and Neymar will be the great player of Barcelona post-Messi. So much that I think it is like trying to break into a safe &#8211; impossible. Meanwhile Mourinho says he is totally against international friendlies following injuries to key central defenders Chris Smalling and Phil Jones on England duty. &#8211; AFP.
