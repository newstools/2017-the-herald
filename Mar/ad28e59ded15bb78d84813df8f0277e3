MIAMI. In-form Roger Federer powered his way into the fourth round of the Miami Open tennis tournament with a 6-3 6-4 win over Argentina s Juan Martin del Potro on Monday. Del Potro always enjoys plenty of crowd support in Miami, which has a large Argentine community, and it was the same story again with football-style chants of support ringing out for the 28-year-old on a packed Crandon Park centre court.It was the pair s first meeting since 2013 and having won 15 of the previous 21 encounters, Federer was favourite but the crowd factor gave the third round match an added edge. Shortly before I walked out to the court you could sense the atmosphere.That s when I told myself, Just be prepared for something different, you know. It was different, Federer said. He was forced to save four break points in the first set but he got ahead with a thundering forehand to take a 5-3 lead and served out for the set. AFP.
