Matthew 11 vs 28 Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. As I was scrolling down the contact list on my phone, I realised that every other person there, is currently dealing with some form of difficulty in their life.It could be a bereavement, an errant child, financial difficulties, a broken relationship, a spiritual deficit or disconnection from God or challenges at work, the list is endless.As I thought through all the issues that people are dealing with, it got me thinking that sometimes the burdens can seem like they are heavier than we can carry. We feel like giving up or running away because during those difficult moments it s almost impossible to see an end in sight.The truth is that the Lord created us in such a way that, when we are heavy laden we must turn to Him and Him alone. We can seek solutions anywhere else but the relief will be temporary. Unless and until we subjugate and subordinate ourselves to Him, we will not find permanent solutions.He wants us to come to Him, and He will provide us the emotional comfort and strength to overcome. We will always go through difficult times in our lives but God gives us the ability to withstand them, overcome them and keep moving towards all the things we are destined for.The thorns as we know them, may never really dissipate or go away, but through Him, you learn to cope and to find joy in adversity. He will lift your spirits and help you to soldier on, knowing that despite the odds He will help you to land safely.So whatever you are facing won t stop you from reaching your destiny but rather, like Paul said, it will be a thorn in your side that keeps you seeking God even more, while you go about the business of life.Rest assured that through it all, there will be time to smile, laugh and let your hair down. So look around you today, everyone has issues and burdens. Only God can give us the comfort of knowing that everything will be alright.Seek Him today.Be blessed.For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; Email us [email&#160;protected] Catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620 hours.&nbsp;
