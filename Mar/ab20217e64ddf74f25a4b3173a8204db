Noel Munzabwa in SWAZILAND AFTER 195 days on the payroll of MTN National First Division outfit, Matsapha United, former Warriors assistant coach Saul Chaminuka has delivered the Premiership ticket to the club. Champagne bottles were popped on Sunday as Matsapha United, a project Chaminuka has coined The Express Blue Train , crushed Sikhalo 3-1 to clinch the first of the two promotion berths.The win puts the club on 47 points from 19 league matches, with three matches to play. Champagne bottles may be popped for promotion, it s fine for the boys, team leadership and the fans but the job is not done yet. I want to win all the remaining matches because I want to be the best, said Chaminuka. When they took me from Zimbabwe, they saw something extra which was not there, otherwise they would have hired a Swazi coach. There were moments when I truly felt we were oversized for the second tier and that feeling inspired us and will continue to inspire us throughout the remainder of the season. With promotion in the bag, Chaminuka could now go for a jugular and take aim at the country s richest knockout tournament, the SwaziBank Cup, which has a ticket to the CAF Confederation Cup.They knocked defending champions, Mbabane Swallows 2-1 in the tournament s biggest upset ever.
