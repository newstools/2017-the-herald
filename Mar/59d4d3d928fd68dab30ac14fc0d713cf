Today is International Women s Day, a day set aside by the United Nations to celebrate the triumphs of women around the world. Running under the theme Be Bold for Change, the celebrations come against the backdrop of remarkable achievements Zimbabwe has made over the years to empower women. Notable achievements have been recorded in economic, social and political spheres and several projects meant to benefit women are already on the horizon as Government affirms its commitment towards gender equality.Today s celebrations will coincide with ongoing celebrations countrywide following the recent High Court decision to award women in unregistered customary marriages part of the property accumulated during the subsistence of such unions.The ruling by Justice Alfas Chitakunye will bring relief to hundreds of women across the country who were in similar unions and had nowhere to seek recourse after nullification of such unions or the death of a spouse.The legislative intervention by the bench is among several initiatives that Government has made to ensure that women do not continue to be treated as second class citizen as was the case during the colonial era and soon after independence.Such legal provisions have even been extended to our girls, who can now concentrate on their education, without worrying about early child marriages after yet another landmark ruling that outlawed marriage for people under the age of 18.Dealing with early child marriages had become a challenge that was affecting the well being of our girls, while denting the country s record on the empowerment of the girl child.Today our girls are blossoming wherever they are, excelling in various fields especially in academic work, where they are topping the lists in secondary public examinations.All these Government concerted efforts towards gender equality are not being done in isolation, but are being enabled by provisions enshrined in the Constitution.Adopted in 2013, the Constitution gives legal guidelines to the Government at all levels, the private sector, traditional and religious leaders, all institutions in society and women, men and youths on how to ensure that every one has equal access to resources and opportunitiesTouted as the best Constitution that looks at women s rights, the provisions on gender equality did not emerge from the blue, but were borrowed from different pieces of legislation promulgated into law in the 1980s and 1990s.While the Government is doing all it can to support gender equality and equity, it is high time they should do away with rhetoric and walk the talk when it comes to women s economic empowerment and their participation in national issues.As this year s theme rightly says, Government and institutions will need to move from mere talk to action, to ensure that there is gender equality and equity in all our institutions.By policing the implementation of existing legislation, the Government can help enhance the empowerment of women.
