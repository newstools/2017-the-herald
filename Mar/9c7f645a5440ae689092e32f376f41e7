It s three weeks away from Easter and I hope the hen is about to hatch the eggs. Yippee, soon we will be talking about the Easter egg but the bunny is difficult to catch.How many of you have a bunny as a pet? Let me just pose the question.Still in line with that, even Hollywood has capitalised on these remarkable relationships with Disney classics such as Homeward Bound , 101 Dalmatians and Old Yeller. No doubt, people love their pets, and their pets love them.Pets can be especially beneficial if your teen struggles with emotional and psychological issues.Research has consistently shown that owning a pet is good for a person s emotional and physical well-being.Given that about one in five adolescents struggle with a mental disorder, the idea that a furry friend could help them is well worth exploring.While certainly professional counselling and medication may be what the doctor ordered, a four-legged companion could also help improve your teen s well-being.Many teens may lack the necessary coping skills to deal with troublesome emotions.All too often these teens are left to face their inner demons alone, but that doesn t have to be the case.Studies have shown that teens who are attached to a pet tend to function better emotionally in comparison to peers who don t own a pet.Besides pets are a lot easier to hug than a person.Let s face it, many teens aren t all that affectionate.But a pet can turn that around.I have a puppy and if you want to see him, obvious go on my IG or Snapchat and interact with the dog. I keep him safe and his name is Tyrone (my childhood icon).Enough of the pets and not far from social media news, we heard that reserved queen Selena Gomez deletes her Instagram at least once a week due to negative comments.In an interview with the New York Times, Selena Gomez dishes on her latest project, the upcoming Netflix original 13 Reasons Why , and what inspired her to produce the series.It turns out that Gomez s own experiences with bullying are what originally inspired her to acquire the rights to the story and adapt it for the small screen, with her mother co-producing alongside her.She told the Times, I knew what it meant to be bullied. I went to the biggest high school in the world, which is the Disney Channel. And my mom had a lot of history dealing with bullying. She also mentioned her hot-and-cold relationship with Instagram comments, explaining that she tends to fixate on the negative comments. I delete the App from my phone at least once a week, she said, continuing, It s like they want to cut to your soul. Imagine all the insecurities that you already feel about yourself and having someone write a paragraph pointing out every little thing even if it s just physical. Meanwhile her ex, our favourite boy Justin Bieber recently showed off his new ink while dancing with one special lady.The boy has had a bit of a falling-out with his fans lately.From ending all meet-and-greets back in 2016 to telling fans in Melbourne that they make him sick, he s certainly had a roller-coaster relationship with his Beliebers.Well, one very lucky fan got more than a meet-and-greet she got a shirtless dance with the Biebz himself!Luckily, he posted videos of the lovely encounter on his Instagram account for all of us to see:We re unsure of the woman s identity, but this likely took place in a bar in New Zealand where the Biebz has been vacationing since the end of the Australian leg of his tour.On couch potato I hear they have remade Power Rangers .It premi red in Los Angeles on Wednesday and some fans are still sceptical about it.Enough of that, our countdown continues for the Fast and The Furious 8 which is world premi ring on April 14 and wow TopGear.com has a properly world exclusive clip from the upcoming movie to show you.Yup, you can watch one-and-a-bit-minutes worth of street racing footage where Dom played by Vin Diesel is racing some seriously old muscle in Cuba.Ah yes, Cuba.The filmmakers had apparently always wanted Cuba to host a Fast film, and this is handy because it reminds you that yes, many moons ago, the films used to be about actual drag racing. Cuba is well known for its car culture, the film s producers said.TopGear.com of course, knows this full well, having spent some time on the streets with Havana s street racers, which you can read more about here.Enjoy the weekend and don forget to #clsweekendvibe on your social media.
