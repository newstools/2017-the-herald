A number of the army s traditional partners, including retail giant OK Zimbabwe, insurer Zimnat, brewer Delta Beverages and mobile phone manufacturer GTel attended the dinner.Speaking at the event at Army Headquarters, ZNA Commander Lieutenant-General Philip Valerio Sibanda said they will continue to develop partnerships with the corporate world to foster good relations. The objective of this initiative is to develop synergies between the military and business and in doing this, we are guided by our vision, which is to create cordial, harmonious and mutually beneficial interactive relationships between the military and corporate sector, said Lt-Gen Sibanda.The ZNA Commander said the executive interaction initiative had already been adopted by other African countries. The ZNA initiative is now the envy of the Sadc region and some of our neighbours are in the process of setting up similar initiatives, which means there will be competition between them and us on how well organised and interesting our activities and events will be, he said.Lt-Gen Sibanda urged the national organising committee to assist in strengthening the provincial Executive Interaction Initiative starting with the weakest.He took the opportunity to observe a minute of silence in honour of the late Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) Vice Chancellor, Professor Primrose Kurasha, who died last month.He said the late Professor Kurasha contributed immensely to the cordial relations that exist between the army and ZOU.
