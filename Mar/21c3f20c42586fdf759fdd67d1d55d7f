MADRID. Villarreal president Fernando Roig was annoyed by the match officials who handled his side s clash with Real Madrid last weekend he claimed the referees were seen carrying bags for the Spanish giants. Real came from behind on Sunday to beat Villarreal 3-2 and reclaim top spot in La Liga. However, the comeback was helped by a questionable penalty decision in favour of Zinedine Zidane s men. What has surprised me and made me laugh is that the referees have come out (of the stadium)with Real Madrid (plastic]) bags, Roig told Cadena Cope radio. They were carrying (plastic) bags of Real Madrid. I don t know what they had in those bags. Our coach did not like that the refereeing delegate came to say goodbye and while he shook our coach s hand, with the other he was holding a Real Madrid bag. He didn t like it. I don t think that is good. Roig added: I just don t think it s a good image. They tell me it s common. But they have not come out with Villarreal bags. The Spanish Referees Committee (CTA) explained to Marca that the plastic bags contained Real Madrid merchandising such as keychains, pins and pens . TeamTalk.
