PARIS. Numerous pitch invasions forced Monday night s international friendly soccer match between Ivory Coast and Senegal in Paris to be abandoned before full-time. The sides were level at 1-1 at the 20 000-capacity Charlety Stadium on the southern outskirts of the capital when French referee Tony Chapron called off the match in the 88th minute as fans from both sides flooded on to the pitch. Liverpool forward Sadio Mane had given Senegal the lead on 67 minutes from the penalty spot, but Fulham s Cyriac Gohi Bi equalised for the Ivorians just four minutes later.Manchester United s Eric Bailly, Everton s Idrissa Gueye and Crystal Palace s Wilfried Zaha were also playing in the match, which was called off with two minutes remaining.It was reported that a group of spectators outside the ground climbed over security fences and entered the stadium just before the trouble began.
