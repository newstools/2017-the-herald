Former acting chief Marange died the day before yesterday and was declared a liberation hero. He had not been feeling well for some time and his death is a loss to the entire Manicaland Province, he said.During the late Cde Marange s tenure, the province witnessed the launch of the Marange-Zimunya Community Share Trust in which he was the chairman.In an interview yesterday night, Dr Mushohwe, said: We have lost a dedicated cadre who did a lot to Manicaland during his tenure as acting chief as well as a zanu-pf Provincial Executive Committee member. Despite being the traditional leader for Marange for a long time, the late former acting chief Marange worked very well with other traditional leaders under his jurisdiction. He had time to listen to people s concerns and was very respectful to people s ideas and suggestions. He was very cooperative and as the chairman of the Marange-Zimunya Community Share Trust, he pushed very hard for the companies that were operating in Chiadzwa to release some of the money they had promised to inject into the Trust when President Mugabe launched the Trust in Marange. He worked tirelessly for the improvement of lives in Mutare District and he will be solely missed by everyone, said Dr Mushohwe.Last November, the late Cde Marange was among the elders of the Marange clan who questioned the installation of Mr Bernard Makungauta Murwira as the substantive chief, alleging that the new chief was corruptly installed in violation of standing cultural succession procedures.They said last November s surprise installation ceremony, which was never attended by members of the Marange clan, including the acting chief as well as 10 headmen under the chieftainship, was a farce.
