KAMPALA. &#8211; Excessive use of social media has led to moral decay in the country and poor performance among students, says Uganda Martyrs University (UMU) Vice Chancellor, Dr John Chrysostom Maviiri. According to Dr Maviiri, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp, among others, take a lot of youths time. He called on church leaders, teachers and parents to regulate where, how and when they should be used, saying, It is good for accessing information but for entertainment, pornography and casual chats, let us reduce and concentrate on harvesting positive knowledge to build a concrete future generation. How can you use Facebook when a teacher is in class? Or why does someone access Whatsapp in the Lord s Holy House, moreover amidst a Holy Mass? he wondered.He was addressing students from at least 30 schools countrywide and other East African countries during a career guidance talk at UMU s Graduation Square recently.The function was organised under the theme: Nurturing youths for employability and wealth creation: The role of higher education institutions. Let us stop the tendency of teaching our students to pass, but give them information that will make them employable, anytime and anywhere. Be ethical, presentable and competent to serve the society in a good manner, Dr Maviiri advised teachers. &#8211; The Monitor-HR.
