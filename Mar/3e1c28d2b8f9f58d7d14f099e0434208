Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter FORGOTTEN ZIFA Northern Region Division One side Starbill director Rickson Zenda believes they still have something to offer to local football despite being in the unfashionable Division Two. The Shipping Boys were relegated from Northern Region in 2015 and spent the better part of last year in the Harare Province Division Two A, but Zenda said they are doing well.He said most of their players are now attached with Premiership clubs.Starbill have produced several players, including Takunda Sadiki who is now with Dynamos.They have also produced Amon Kambanje (CAPS United), Talent Mandizadza (ZPC Kariba), Marlon Mushonga (Tsholotsho), Maxwell Murimi and Travor Mavhunga (both Shabanie), Munyaradzi Chipo and Johane Sibanda (Yadah Stars) and Gibson Chinobva.Zenda believes the project was reaping rewards. I think the project is now bearing fruit as we have several players who made it into the Premier League since last year. The project needs patience and as things stand we are happy with the results as it is not easy to groom a player until he becomes a professional, but so far we have, at least, eight players who passed through our hands and are now in the top-flight. I did not completely take a back seat, but I am now looking after the players as their intermediary. As an Academy we will continue to work hard and produce some players as that was our core business from the beginning, said ZendaThe Academy was established in August 2009 with the vision of identifying and grooming future football stars.The team was originally sponsored by two companies who are both into shipping and transport business Startrack Freight Services and Shereni Transport.
