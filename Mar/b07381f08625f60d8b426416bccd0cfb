Deputy Minister Thokozile MathuthuLovemore Meya Herald Correspondent Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Deputy Minister Thokozile Mathuthu has challenged the Women s University in Africa to lead in research and foreground women issues to address gender disparities. Deputy Minister Mathuthu said this recently at a media cocktail hosted by WUA following the official opening of its new campus in Manresa, along Acturus Road in Harare. As we begin the digital broadcasting journey, we worry about content deficiency, said Deputy Minister Mathuthu. The mandate of WUA, which I am informed is to address gender disparity and foster equity in university education, makes it a hub for content in whatever format that is, television programmes, radio or print. As a ministry, we are going round the country inviting content producers to spread their wings and get into the business of content production. There is no need to search further, especially focusing on gender equality and women empowerment. Speaking at the same event, WUA Vice Chancellor and founder Professor Hope Sadza said they were happy to be engaging with the media. We felt of telling our story and share the journey with the media, informing them as they report on our struggle on the gender agenda, she said. We want to better equip you in terms of information on our programmes, launch and research outputs, which are useful as you gather content for news production. The event was sponsored by Nash Paints and was attended by Government officials, different media houses, including Zimpapers which was represented by group editorial executive William Chikoto and Kwayedza editor Patrick Shamba.
