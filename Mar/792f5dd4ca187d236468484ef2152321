Everyone knew that Chibaya was the lead vocalist and after his death we were so devastated. We even thought that we could not carry on with music but we want to thank God that we have finally managed to get back on our feet again. We are pleading with our fans to accept the new Chiedza Chevatendi because we did not try to sound like Chibaya or the way we sounded when Chibaya was with us but we used our own voices and the sound might have taken a new twist, he said.Gadzikwa said Chibaya s death had affected the group leading to delays in releasing the album. To tell you the truth the death of Chibaya was a huge blow to us as a group because by the time of his death we had a number of songs which were ready for recording in which he was leading so it was difficult for us to go ahead and record the songs. He said they have special dedications to Chibaya in their latest offering. We penned the song Tinyaradzei Ishe and Mureverere for Chibaya and we are dedicating the whole album to him, he said.Gadzikwa who apologised to their fans for the delay paid tribute superstar Oliver Mtukudzi for standing with them and encouraging them to come up with the latest album. We would like to thank Dr Mtukudzi for being there for us and for his encouragement. It is because of him that we released the album, he said.
