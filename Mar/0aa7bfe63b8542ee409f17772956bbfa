BRUSSELS. &#8211; The European Union should consider restricting visas for senior officials from African and other states which refuse to take back illegal immigrants from Europe, Germany s interior minister said on Monday. Brussels, Thomas de Maiziere told reporters that the bloc needed to use all the levers at its disposal to ensure countries cooperated with Europe s efforts to deport those arriving who were not entitled to asylum. With hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving on Europe s beaches every year, European governments have grown increasingly irritated at refusals by some African and Asian states to take back people who do not qualify for refugee status &#8211; Reuters/Africa News.
