Municipal Reporter Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) has embarked on massive water disconnections to recover close to $150 million it is owed by various clients, including Beitbridge and Gwanda town councils. As of December 31, 2016, Zinwa was owed $146 117 812 by various clients including irrigation schemes, Government departments, parastatals, local authorities, domestic users, industry and mines.Zinwa public relations and marketing manager Mrs Marjory Munyonga said the ongoing exercise will see the disconnection of water supplies for all those clients whose accounts are in arrears and those who reneged on payment plans. Zinwa therefore advises all those clients whose accounts are not paid up to make sure that they pay up or enter into acceptable payment plans with their respective Zinwa Catchments. All those clients who have queries regarding their bills are advised to visit their respective catchment offices. This disconnection exercise is part of a raft of measures Zinwa has employed in order to enforce payment for service by clients, she said.Mrs Munyonga said other measures include legal action and continuous engagement of clients.The non-payment of bills by clients, she said, has negatively impacted on Zinwa s ability to sustainably provide service and as a result the authority has not been able to repair and maintain water reticulation infrastructure, procure critical spares and build up water treatment chemical stocks.
