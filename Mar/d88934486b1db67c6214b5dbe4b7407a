DUNEDINE. South Africa and New Zealand s cricket captains both claimed to have gained a psychological edge after rain washed out the final day of the first Test in Dunedin yesterday.Despite New Zealand suffering the loss of batsman Ross Taylor for the second Test, captain Kane Williamson felt buoyed by the his side being able to establish a 33-run first innings lead. To put partnerships together against the very good attack they have was a good effort, he said after play was abandoned without a ball bowled yesterday, leaving South Africa on 224 for six in their second innings, a lead of 191 runs. You always want more, which never goes away no matter how many you get, but it was nice to get a little lead going into that second innings. AFP&nbsp;
