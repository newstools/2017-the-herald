Abigail Mawonde Herald Correspondent The Zimbabwe Platinum Mines (Zimplats) yesterday donated goods worth $68 000 to victims of floods following an appeal for assistance by Government. The goods comprised 50 tonnes of sugar beans, peanut butter, water tanks, drinking water and larvicide for the control of malaria in affected areas.Speaking during the handover ceremony in Harare, Zimplats head of corporate affairs Mrs Busi Chindove said they were happy to assist. As responsible corporate citizens, we cannot just stand by and watch as so many of our fellow country men and women are struggling with the after effects of these adverse weather conditions, she said. We are aware that Government launched an appeal to assist those in need following the floods. As a result, we engaged the Civil Protection Unit for guidance on the various needs of the affected communities. Mrs Chindove said plans to partner Government on infrastructural development were in progress. We are also aware of Government s appeal for corporates to contribute towards the rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged during the heavy rains and subsequent floods, she said. This appeal is receiving positive consideration and our proposed interventions will be communicated through our parent ministry in due course. Mrs Chindove appealed to the corporate world to contribute to the worthy cause.
