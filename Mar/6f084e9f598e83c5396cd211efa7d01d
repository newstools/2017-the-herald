Mutare Bureau Mission schools and churches should join the Government-initiated Command Agriculture scheme as they stand to benefit, says a Cabinet Minister. Minister of Information, Media and Broadcasting Services, Dr Christopher Mushohwe, made the remarks during a welcome ceremony held for the United Methodist Church s Reverend Archiford Muchingami at Chipfatsura in Marange on Sunday. Dr Mushohwe urged churches to actively participate in the Command Agriculture scheme as this would result in increased production.He said United Methodist Church should emulate St Noah s College of the Johane Marange Apostolic Church, which is expecting a bumper harvest after actively participating in the Command Agriculture scheme. The Johane Marange Apostolic Church took advantage of the Command Agriculture scheme and are expecting a bumper harvest. If other churches take up the initiative, the country will regain its status as Africa s breadbasket, he said.Dr Mushohwe said since implementing the scheme last year, the country had exceeded its normal agricultural production levels and had produced enough crops to feed the whole nation.He advised the new spiritual leader for the Chipfatsura flock, Rev Muchingami to keep it together and unite them as they were under his supervision.He said it was the duty of the pastor to see that the congregants were put back on the right direction if lost, and to guide them during their journey on earth.He however warned the pastor to be wary of wolves in sheep s skin. Jesus did not surrender after all the trials and tribulations, but soldiered on. Do not give up if such people come to you, but keep leading them spiritually as well as physically, he said.Dr Mushohwe hailed the United Methodist Church for continually attracting more youth members to the church.Youths came in their numbers to welcome Rev Muchingami. Our future depends on this young generation and it is commendable that parents from around this area are still encouraging their children to come to church. A prayerful generation is what we want for our country, he said.
