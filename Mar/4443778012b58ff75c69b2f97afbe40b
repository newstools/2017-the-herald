HAMILTON. South Africa paid homage to a fabulous Kane Williamson yesterday after the New Zealand captain s 176 left the Proteas on the ropes with a day to play in the deciding final Test cricket in Hamilton. We ve got a mountain to climb, assistant coach Adrian Birrell said after South Africa were reduced to 80 for five at stumps on day four, 95 runs short of making New Zealand bat again. Kane Williamson s innings was a fabulous innings and you ve got to sometimes doff your cap to a good player. With Colin de Grandhomme also firing with the bat with a quickfire 57, New Zealand started the day seven runs ahead and added 168 before they were all out for 489.De Grandhomme then ignited the assault on the South African top order in the sixth over when he removed Dean Elgar for five and later took a smart catch to dismiss Hashim Amla for 19.
