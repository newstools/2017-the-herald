LONDON. Four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah says he is happy to be drug-tested any time, anywhere and for any of his historical samples to be reanalysed. The Briton has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and says he has nothing to hide, after a leaked United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report suggested that his coach had almost certainly broken anti-doping rules.Following more media claims at the weekend, Farah said in quotes reported by several British newspapers yesterday that he was happy to comply with the wishes of any anti-doping authority. I m not aware of any request, he said. But as I ve said many times, I m happy to be tested any time, anywhere and have any of my samples tested or retested now or at any time in the future, by any official body. AFP.&nbsp;
