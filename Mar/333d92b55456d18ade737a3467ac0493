Marine Le PenPARIS. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen could win the forthcoming presidential election in France, President Francois Hollande warned yesterday, vowing to do everything in his power to stop it happening. Polls suggest that Le Pen, leader of the National Front (FN), is likely to win the first round of France s election on April 23.However, surveys also show she would then lose in the deciding second-round run-off on May 7 either to the centrist and pro-business Emmanuel Macron or conservative candidate Francois Fillon.But with Fillon s campaign in turmoil over accusations that he paid his wife for a fake parliamentary job from public funds, analysts have warned that the election is extremely difficult to predict. There is a threat of Le Pen winning the election, Hollande acknowledged in comments to French daily Le Monde. AFP.
