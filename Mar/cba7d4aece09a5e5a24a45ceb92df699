DUNEDIN. &#8211; Kane Williamson produced a 16th Test cricket century to give New Zealand a slight edge despite a career-best 5-94 by the South African left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who restricted the hosts to 341 in the first innings of the first Test at the University Oval in Dunedin yesterday. An attacking Hashim Amla led a determined counter-offensive as he steered South Africa to 38 for one at the close, a first-innings lead of 5.Amla struck five fours and dominated the two spinners, Jeetan Patel and Mitchell Santner. He left the scene on 23 at the close enforced due to bad light. Dean Elgar, on 12, will resume with Amla today.Stephen Cook was caught behind for a duck in the first over despite missing the ball by at least two inches.His bat did hit his pads and the right-handed batsman did not refer the marching orders issued by Bruce Oxenford to the TV-official.A fire alarm enforced a temporary evacuation of the ground by the players, spectators and TV-crew.The fire brigade investigated and it transpired that the alarm was accidentally activated.Earlier, Williamson ignited the University Oval with his 130 off 241 balls with 18 fours. His ton, and a half-century by BJ Watling, gave the Kiwi s a 33-run first-innings cushion. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
