The ZIFA boss was leaving for Egypt. You are currently the two teams who are doing Zimbabwe proud at the moment. I want you to go to Angola and fly the Zimbabwe flag high. I also want CAPS United to do the same when they fly to DRC on Sunday, said Chiyangwa. I hope you will bring positive results and continue to fly the national flag high. I am proud of you. I want to see players from Ngezi and players from CAPS United donning the national team jersey because we want players at the national team. (Callisto) Pasuwa did his part. We are still looking for a coach saka nhasi ndiri kuda kumboonawo wenyu. The Mighty Warriors coach did the same and I am very proud of the two teams and their coaches. We need men and women who will take over the baton and take us further. The matches over the weekend means a lot for us as ZIFA and as Zimbabwe. I wish all the teams a successful adventure. As the ZIFA president I want positive results. The businessman later bought drinks, water, tea and food worth $650 for the Ngezi players and their technical team as they waited for their flight to South Africa. Chiyangwa also took time to discuss with Ngezi coaches Gift Muzadzi and Tonderai Ndiraya and wished them well. I was touched by the gesture of our football president. We will try and bring a positive result and I hope CAPS United will also do the same, said defender Partson Jaure.
