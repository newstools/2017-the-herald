LONDON. Jose Mourinho accused Mesut Ozil of being a coward who thinks 50 per cent is enough in an explosive dressing room row at Real Madrid. Arsenal playmaker Ozil (28) has revealed the details of his relationship with the Manchester United manager and an insight into his famous temper. Ozil has also revealed he turned down a move to Manchester United and how a Pep Guardiola no-show convinced him to snub a dream transfer to Barcelona.The Germany midfielder, who played under Mourinho for three years at the Bernabeu, says his boss called him out for thinking beautiful passes were his only responsibility.Ozil has been criticised for a perceived lack of effort since moving to the Emirates Stadium in 2013 but Mourinho took him to task.In his new autobiography, serialised by German newspaper BILD and published by the Sport Witness website, Ozil says Mourinho shouted at him, saying: You think two beautiful passes are enough You think you re so good that 50 per cent is enough. Mourinho is said to have stared Ozil down as they squared up to each other, like boxers at a stare-down , before adding: Oh, are you giving up now? You re such a coward. What do you want? To creep under the beautiful, warm shower? Shampoo your hair? To be alone? Or do you want to prove to your fellow players, the fans out there, and me, what you can do. Ozil, who claims he threw his match shirt back at his manager, chose the shower a decision he is said to regret. Mailonline.
