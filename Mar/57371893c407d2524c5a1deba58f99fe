Deuteronomy 6 vs 5; You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. We spend a considerable amount of time expressing love and yearning to be loved back. Our lives centre around the manifestation and sharing of love. We speak so much of it that our lives literally revolve around love. The question is: how do you show love and how do you express it? Do we show it through actions or is it words that ultimately declare what we feel?A friend of mine has always famously said where you are loved and vice versa you can clearly feel it.We often ask the Lord to show us His love and to shower us with blessings. We want His love for us to be displayed physically as much as it is spiritually. We literally demand that the promises He has made to us should come alive in every way possible.The question I want to pose as a challenge to you today is: do you show your love to the Creator of heaven and earth? Have you clearly stated that He is the only one, the Alpha and the Omega?As you seek to hold Him to the promises He has made, make it a point to make Him your only God. Show Him that He is the only one and you have entrusted your life into His hands. Love God like you have never done before and, as you put Him at the top of the list of your priorities you will see His goodness come alive in your life.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on [email&#160;protected]; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
