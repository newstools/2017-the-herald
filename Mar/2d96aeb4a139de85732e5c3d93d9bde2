INDIAN WELLS. &#8211; Third-seeded Stan Wawrinka continued his dominance of Philipp Kohlschreiber, rolling past the German 7-5, 6-3 on Monday to reach the fourth round of the ATP Indian Wells Masters tennis tournament. Wawrinka recorded his fifth victory over Kohlschreiber in as many meetings in a performance that left him cautiously encouraged about his prospects of making it past the quarter-finals in the California desert for the first time. It was a really good match, said Wawrinka, who owns three Grand Slam titles but has won just one of the tour s coveted Masters titles. The first set was not easy, for sure, but in general I m happy with my game. I was serving well. I think I m moving better and better and it s all positive so far. A break in each set was enough for Wawrinka, who didn t face a break point himself as he advanced to a meeting with lucky loser Yoshihito Nishioka of Japan, who staged a remarkable rally to get past 13th-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych 1-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4.The 21-year-old from Mie saved a match point against his own serve in the 10th game of the second set. &#8211; AFP.
