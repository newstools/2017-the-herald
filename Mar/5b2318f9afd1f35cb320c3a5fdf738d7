Mental illness is found in all cultures and races in almost the same proportion, in different parts of the world where chibhoyi (African traditional belief) does not existDr Sacrifice Chirisa Mental Health Issues Of all the specialties in the bible of medicine, there is no other arm shrouded in enigma like psychiatry.Most of the departments are clearly defined with an easy to follow and identifiable causes of illnesses. This has led to serious disputes as to what causes mental health issues and has also led to serious stigma, prolonged suffering of mental health patients.This situation is worsened by our local religious beliefs both traditional and Christian.If this is examined more closely, they interpret mental illness in the same manner.Traditionally, our culture talks about mamhepo, kubata mushonga, kugarwa, ngozi, kuroiwa and kutanda botso, just to mention a few.Of the many ways used to describe mental illness, in the Christian world; terminology like possession by demons, tribal spirits and generational curse, are used interchangeably to explain mental health issues.In my view these were acceptable explanations in the absence or ignorance of current medical scientific evidence, which has proved beyond any doubt that mental illness is a direct result of brain malfunction.Functional brain scans like Positron Emission Topography (PET) used in research setting have demystified mental illness to be a result of abnormal brain function.The completion of the human genome studies opened a whole world of specific genes are associated with specific mental illness.There is a large body of evidence and knowledge in this regard.Refusing to accept it is like refusing to use a cellphone and social media preferring to post your mail with the postman.If our traditional explanations were correct, why does chibhoyi (traditional acts) happen to people who do not participate in or know it?Mental illness is found in all cultures and races in almost the same proportion in different parts of the world where chibhoyi does not exist.The Christian stigmatises mental illness as demonic, yet this same explanation is not used for HIV infection, malaria or high blood pressure (BP).If this was also correct why do the patients improve and get healed on medication without any exorcism or demon casting taking place?While I respect belief systems, they must not become a hindrance to access treatment.On the other hand, patients that have done well on treatment are told to stop medication after some ritual: (Kushandirwa), (Kugadzirwa) or demon casting (Ku delivharwa). This results in relapses and further impairs mental health patients.It also causes people to fear to seek psychiatric medical attention in fear of being labelled or even accused of witchcraft.So many people that could be treated are hiding in homes and families tormented over things with a solution.I believe the time to embrace psychiatric treatment has come. I remember the days when HIV illness was treated in the same light mental illness is being currently treated.Many lives were lost until the society at large embraced the use of ARVs and that the illness was caused by an identifiable biological agent.In the same vein this transformation must happen for mental health issues.This is not meant to offend anyone and I apologise in advance if it does.My intention is clear; to have mental patients access medical care. Most problems are treatable.Dr Sacrifice Chirisa is a passionate mental health specialist, who holds an undergraduate medical degree and postgraduate degree in Psychiatry from the University of Zimbabwe.
