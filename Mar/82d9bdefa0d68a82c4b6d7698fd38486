Collin Matiza Sports Editor SPILLS and thrills will once again be the order of the day when this year s National Circuit Racing season gets off the ground this weekend at Donnybrook Raceway in Harare with the staging of the Sables Grand Prix. A full field of cars and bikes are expected with a number of new entries and a couple of South African bike competitors making for an exciting day s racing on Sunday.There is a full racing programme consisting of saloon and sports cars, and Open and Megelli class motor bikes.The biggest interest should be around the Open saloon car class where last year s champion, Rowan Whyte, will have his hands full against a full field, including last year s runner-up Richard Robinson and Barney Rogers, in his ultra quick rotary powered Lancer.Newcomer Jim Perry will set to the track in his new BMW Turbo and will hope to emulate his son Hamish in a similar car who managed to set one of the fastest times at Donnybrook last year in only his second outing of the season.Another newcomer, Craig Bond, will bring out his rotary powered Mazda sports which will certainly have the legs on all the cars in a straight line. Steve Murton, in his kit car, will be hoping for more reliability to show what he can do.It is hoped that Byron Norman from Bulawayo will make the journey to kick-start his effort to finish better than his 3rd place last year.The two-litre saloon car class should again see last year s champion Hilton Harunavamwe taking the honours ahead of Clayton Green and Bulawayo s Calvin Rademeyer.A full field is expected in the 1600 saloon car class with a couple of newcomers, including Austin Chitepo, son of rally ace George, who is entering a Corolla 1600.Speaking to The Herald yesterday, George Chitepo said after having been involved in motor racing in this country and in South Africa for close to a decade now, he has now decided to take a back seat and pass on the baton to his 19-year-old son Austin. As you know I m slightly over the hill and getting old after each and every passing year and I ve now decided to pass on the knowledge that I gained in motor racing over the past years to my son Austin who is now ready to take over the reins from me. He (Austin) has always been an avid motor racing follower and he has now decided to enter the fray and showcase his skills in main circuit racing, starting from this Sunday at Donnybrook and I, as his father, will give him all the necessary support in this demanding but very exciting sport. Mind you, he s only 19 and I think he will be a big hit in main circuit racing as he gains some experience, George Chitepo said.Drag star Mano Zevgolis will also be making his debut in a Honda similar to last year s champion Mike Laing s car. With two equally powered cars it will be interesting to see if Zevgolis can transfer his dragging skills to the circuit. Veterans Craig Green, Mike Exton and Brett Stopforth will ensure that these are not the only cars vying for the win on Sunday.In the Sports cars, last year s tussle between Barney Rogers and eventual winner Fanie van der Linde is set to continue.Driving similar powered cars, these two split the honours the whole of the year with some exciting racing.Eric Heard, in his Yamaha powered 7, will be there to profit on any mistakes these two may make.
