Gianni InfantinoWHEN FIFA president Gianni Infantino led a high-powered delegation from the world football governing body on a two-day visit to this country two weeks ago, there were a number of prophets of doom who were quick to dismiss it as yet another meaningless trip by one of the world s most powerful men. In our country, where a sizeable number of people don t want to see anything progressive happening, there were many who rushed to their Twitter feeds and Facebook pages, after Infantino s arrival was delayed by about four hours, that the Fifa boss would not come here and all the stories about his trip were a farce.We understand where these people stand, driven by their agenda of negativity, who have even come to hurt their own motherland simply because they want to further their ambitions, political or otherwise, which would be hampered by any feel-good story coming out of this country.These are the same people you hear today suggesting that we won t have a bumper maize harvest this year, when everything points to that, because they believe that a Zimbabwe which has more than its fair share of its food reserves is a danger, where its people are not hungry and happy, is a threat to their dark ambitions.They are the same people you have probably heard on Twitter or Facebook saying that the Command Agriculture programme has not been a success and will not produce more than enough food for this nation because their focus has long been whittled down to the narrow interests of their political machinations.And, as much it hurts us to say so, they are the same people who get sleepless nights when they learn that the latest cyclone to develop in the Indian Ocean will not cause any damage in Zimbabwe because all they want to see is destruction and turmoil in this country because they believe that is the only way their foolish political interests will be served and enhanced.But, refreshingly, the world is moving on while they remain chained to their dreams, if not nightmares, which will never come to pass.And, whether they wanted it or not, Infantino and his secretary-general Fatma Samoura, touched down in Harare for a two-day visit which, as we have seen from communication that has come from Zurich this week, could be a game-changer in our national game.Because Infantino has shown that he means business and in correspondence to President Mugabe, Sports Minister Makhosini Hlongwane and zifa boss Philip Chiyangwa, made it very clear that he is more than determined to help our football rise from the doldrums and fulfil its potential.The Swiss lawyer says he will make it his personal mission to ensure that he finds ways of ensuring the Government s commitment to establish about 8 000 well-organised grassroots football clubs, which the Ministry of Sport believes could help in identifying and developing talent that could transform our Warriors and Young Warriors into world-beaters, becomes a reality.It s not every day that you get such a personal commitment from the leader of world football.It means he has been charmed by what we want to achieve and feels we are on the right track and while we lack the financial resources and technical expertise needed to ensure that this ambitious project becomes a reality, Infantino has the global connections to provide that and FIFA, too, can also come in because they have always placed a high value towards football development.There is no question that we have talent in this country and that Khama Billiat can rise from Mufakose to be voted the second best footballer, plying his trade on the continent, is testimony to that.What we have been lacking is a coordinated programme that will ensure that academies, like the one that developed Khama Billiat s talent, can be established around the country, running under expert supervision, and where the Aces Youth Soccer Academy churned out Khama and Knowledge Musona, a nationwide programme can produce dozens of other very good players.Now that Infantino has made his commitment, we hope our Sports Ministry officials and zifa will not forget that there is need to keep reminding the fifa boss of our needs, asking for his help every time they meet him, because he is a very busy guy and has a lot on his plate in leading world football.And, of course, it felt good to hear the fifa leadership describing our country as beautiful, because we believe that there is weight in their words and if they can be charmed by what our nation has to offer, it s clear that this can open doors for others to come here and explore the beauty of our Zimbabwe.These are certainly interesting times for our country and, contrary to what some prophets of doom might choose to cling to, the future for the nation and our football really looks very good.And with friends like Infantino, seriously, who needs enemies?
