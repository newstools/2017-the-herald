Son Heung-Min s hat-trick fired Tottenham into the FA Cup semi-finals, but his side s 6-0 victory against Millwall was overshadowed by Harry Kane s potentially serious ankle injury. Kane limped off in the 10th minute at White Hart Lane after his ankle twisted awkwardly.The England striker was sidelined with another ankle problem earlier this season and the injury is a major worry for Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino.England manager Gareth Southgate will also be concerned as he is due to name his squad for forthcoming fixtures against Germany and Lithuania.Tottenham are looking to win the FA Cup for the first time since 1991 and close the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea, but those ambitions would be much harder to achieve without their leading scorer.Despite Kane s absence, Tottenham were too strong for third tier Millwall and they marked the last FA Cup tie at the Lane before the stadium is demolished, with a commanding quarterfinal display.Christian Eriksen opened the scoring and Dele Alli and Vincent Janssen were also on target, but it was Son who took centre-stage with his treble.Tottenham will discover their opponent for next month s Wembley semi-finals on Monday, but news of Kane will be anticipated even more eagerly.Given the notorious reputation of Millwall s support, much of the pre-match focus had been on the possibility of crowd trouble.There was a tense atmosphere outside the stadium before kick off, but a huge police presence managed to contain the threat of serious violence despite bottle throwing and minor scuffles.
