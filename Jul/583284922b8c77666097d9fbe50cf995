The visit coincides with the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1992.

India and Israel are walking hand in hand into the future as partners, the editorial said.Ties between the two nations have become more visible since Modi became prime minister in 2014 and Israeli ambassador to India Daniel Carmon said the landmark visit will focus on issues of economic development, innovation, agriculture, water and establishing a better connection between the people of the two countries, as well as defence.Modi is set to hold talks with Netanyahu, whom he calls his friend and is likely to address the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. Modi s trip comes weeks after India approved a defence deal with Israel worth $2bn.The Indian prime minister has been pushing for defence cooperation with Israel, which has agreed to collaborate and support his Make in India initiative. The trip will focus on Expanding business and investment collaboration on the ground. In addition, I hope to get insights into Israel s accomplishments in technology and innovation through on-site visits, Modi wrote on his Facebook page.
