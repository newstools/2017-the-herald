Business Reporter THE National Economic Consultative Forum is undergoing reorganisation with a view to strengthening its dialogue convening mandate. The NECF hopes to resuscitate the Annual National Dialogues in Zimbabwe so as to provide stakeholders an opportunity to discuss socio-economic issues in the country.Executive secretary Norman Chakanetsa told members of the media yesterday while announcing the NECF 20th Anniversary Dinner to be held Friday July 21 at the Rainbow Towers Hotel.The celebrations will be held under the theme: NECF: Celebrating 20 years of Public Private Dialogue for Inclusive Economic Growth . On July 17 we are turning 20 and to celebrate the 20-year milestone we are going to have a dinner on July 21. This is a moment for reflecting on where we have come from and where we are going. The 20th anniversary is an opportunity for stakeholder networking and renewal of commitment to the NECF, said Mr Chakanetsa.Over 500 delegates including senior Government officials, captains of industry and commerce are expected to grace the occasion in honour of the dialogue host which has been instrumental in policy making.Since its formation in 1997, some of the achievements registered by the NECF include hosting three critical annual conferences. It hosts the international business conferences annually during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair week, the Annual National Agribusiness Conference during the Harare Agricultural Show week and the National Economic Symposium.Also, NEC has produced the first ever Zimbabwe National Competitiveness Report in 2015 with the second report being produced last year.The process to produce the third instalment of the Zimbabwe National Competitiveness Report is already in motion. Last year NECF produced the Investor Perception Survey Report while a year earlier produced a Public Private Dialogue Handbooks and Manual for use by Central Government, Local Government and the sector.Mr Chakanetsa said the NECF also laid groundwork for adoption of the multicurrency regime in 2009 and has organised six National Retreats at which President interfaced with stakeholders for open discussion on the economy.He said the organisation will also resuscitate its regional chapters in Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo and Mutare with a view to hosting dialogue on the key issues pertaining to the various provinces.The NECF seeks to create a smart partnership among key economic players including Government, private sector, labour, civil society, academia and other stakeholders in order to enhance the socio-economic development process.It also seeks to provide a broad participatory framework in the formulation of national economic policy through an interchange of ideas and experiences among stakeholders and to facilitate the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of national economic policy implementation.
