LONDON. &#8211; Antonio Conte may have won the English Premiership soccer title in his first season at Chelsea, but he s hardly been singing the Blues this summer. Conte is becoming increasingly frustrated by the club s transfer policy. The Italian is yet to sign a new deal at Stamford Bridge and Starsport understands he has been less than thrilled with the champions transfer policy.Key to his unhappiness has been the decision to go for Everton striker Romelu Lukaku on the recommendation of technical director Michael Emenalo. Conte wanted Torino striker Andrea Belotti, who scored a stunning 28 goals in 38 appearances last season, with both players valued in the region of 85m.Belotti, just 23, might not have made it into Conte s Italy team when he was national boss, but he has been hugely impressed with the progress of Il Gallo &#8211; or the Rooster.But in meetings with director Marina Granovskaia, who has a direct line to owner Roman Abramovich, Conte has learned what a succession of other managers have found out before him &#8211; the manager at Stamford Bridge does not rule the roost.Conte has taken former Blues keeper Carlo Cudicini with him to those meetings so the former keeper and current club ambassador can use his excellent English to get the coach s message across.Unfortunately getting Cudicini to help express his thoughts hasn t always helped. &#8211; The Daily Star.
