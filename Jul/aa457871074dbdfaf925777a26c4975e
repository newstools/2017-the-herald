Manny PacquiaoBRISBANE. Manny Pacquiao s trainer advised the Filipino legend to quit boxing yesterday after his sensational defeat to unheralded Australian Jeff Horn. While controversy raged over the scoring of Sunday s World Boxing Organisation welterweight title bout in Brisbane, after all three judges awarded it to unbeaten Horn, there were doubts whether 38-year-old Pacquiao would return for a possible rematch.Hall of Fame trainer Freddie Roach said he would consider advising Pacquiao to retire after a glittering 22-year professional career in which he won world titles at an unprecedented eight weight divisions. I m going to talk to Manny about maybe calling it a day, maybe this is it, Roach said.Given no chance by most observers, the 29-year-old Horn s ultra-aggressive style rocked Pacquiao, with the three judges scoring the fight 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 to the Australian before 51 000 fans at Suncorp Stadium.Pacquiao, (59-7-2) who insisted on a Brisbane rematch as a clause in his contract for the fight, declared however that he would absolutely return for a rematch.
