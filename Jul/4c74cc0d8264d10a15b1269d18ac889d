LONDON. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has confirmed Alexandre Lacazette s move to Arsenal should be completed within the next day or two . Lacazette is now due to fly into London this week to finalise a club-record move to Arsenal. Arsenal s opening bid of 39m was turned down last month, but significant progress has been made in talks between the clubs.Aulas confirmed the deal is worth up to 43.8m ( 50m), meaning it would eclipse the club-record 42.5m Arsenal paid for Mesut Ozil four years ago. Aulas told French outlet Le Progres: Alexandre Lacazette s transfer to Arsenal could be actioned within the next day or two. The figure reported by the English media of around 67m (including 12m in add-ons) is impossible and not realistic. Arsenal s first offer was around 45m, the transfer will be concluded in the range of 45m to 50m. It constitutes, without doubt, a record transfer fee for Arsenal, [sic] and for Lyon of course! Last month, Lacazette said he would only move to a club who are playing in Europe s premier club competition but it appears the 26-year-old s stance on the matter has softened.Lacazette had verbally agreed to join Atletico Madrid this summer but the move fell through after the Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed on June 1 that Atletico would be banned from registering players during this window.
