Economics lecturer at Africa University Thomas Masese said the worsening cash crisis is dampening consumer demand and consumption of some products hence firms may be slowing the rate at which they review prices. The directive by authorities for price convergence between US dollar, bond cash and transfer prices may also be reducing some prices. However, it looks like the major contributor to inflation slowdown is depressed demand due to worsening liquidity crisis. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels slowed down as landlords lower rentals. Food and non-alcoholic beverages also went down slightly as the price of maize meal has come down due to the increased availability after the bumper harvest. Most categories in the CPI basket went up hence the positive inflation of 0,31, said Mr Masese.
