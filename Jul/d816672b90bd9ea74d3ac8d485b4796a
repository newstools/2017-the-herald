So I am just really happy to finish off this way, playing my last match for a while here in Zimbabwe in front of friends and family. I thought we played really well in the second set and we have been playing well throughout these three weeks. We have only lost one set, said Lock.Lammons said it was great to win. It s just like any title, it s always great, me and Benji have great chemistry. I think today we didn t start out as strong as we would have liked.
