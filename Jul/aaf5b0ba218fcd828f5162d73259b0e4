President MugabeBrian Chitemba Investigations Editor, Sunday Mail PRESIDENT Mugabe has blasted pastors who steal from congregants in the name of God. In the past few years, Zimbabwe has witnessed a mushrooming of pentecostal movements whose often youthful pastors stage-manage miracles to entice congregants from whom they make a fortune through tithes, personal donations and seeding of money.President Mugabe was speaking at the 60th birthday celebrations of his sister-in-law, Mrs Junior Gumbochuma.Read more: President blasts Pentecostal churches Mrs Gumbochuma is First Lady Amai Grace Mugabe s eldest sister.The President and Amai Mugabe gave Mrs Gumbochuma $60 000 as a gift while their children, Russell, Robert Junior, Chatunga, Bona and her husband Mr Simba Chikore gave her $10 000.The gift was to thank Mrs Gumbochuma, a ZAOGA pastor, for the pivotal role she played in raising the First Family s children.President Mugabe took the opportunity to give wise counsel to hundreds of people who gathered for the celebrations.He said individuals should worship God directly, instead of relying on so-called men of God .He said it was shocking that there were pastors who were flocking to Nigeria in search of God.
