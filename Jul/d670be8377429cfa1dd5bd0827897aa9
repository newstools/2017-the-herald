LONDON. Alexis Sanchez will tell Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger this week that he wants to join Manchester City. The wantaway Chilean forward is ready to make his demand official by slapping in a transfer request if Wenger refuses his plea to leave the Emirates on good terms.Sanchez was scheduled to return for pre-season training yesterday after being given extra time to recover from his exploits at the Confederations Cup, but he is still in Chile suffering a bout of flu.Arsenal sent doctors to check up on Sanchez to ensure there was no foul play over his illness claims.Sources in South America insist that the illness is genuine, and not a sign that the 28-year-old is using underhand tactics to agitate for a move. But Sanchez wants to link up again with his former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola.And he has priced himself out of moves to Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain by demanding 400 000 a week.Wenger insists his star striker will not be sold even for 50m, with less than 12 months left on his contract.
