Bipin Dani in MUMBAI, India THE architect of Zimbabwe s historic victory over Sri Lanka, Solomon Mire, would have been flying across the world had he not been a cricketer.Mire scored his first ODI hundred in Galle in a stunning victory for the Chevrons. But he could have been lost to this game. That was my desire (to be a pilot) when I finished my school. A lot has happened since then, he said. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I moved away from planes after I realised I would struggle to make it work time-wise with cricket. Mire, who has spent time in Australia, was a happy man yesterday. It s hard to describe how I feel but it s around ecstatic and very happy and obviously to a certain extent subdued by the fact that there s still a series to play for, he said. But really happy to have contributed to team success and in the process reach a personal milestone. It s a big confidence-booster for the team to come into foreign conditions and play the way we did, only a few days into the trip . The boys will be celebrating a historic win for us for sure but we all know we have given ourselves a shot at going for another win and therefore cannot get too carried away too early.
