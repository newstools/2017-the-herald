Freeman Razemba Herald Reporter Police have widened investigations following reports that Zimbabwe Democratic Teachers Union (ZDTU) leaders misappropriated over $60 000. A forensic audit report by Sustainiverse Management Services dated May 3 noted that teachers contributions were missing from the union s accounts.The audit revealed that member subscriptions and funds for an in-house housing scheme disappeared from the union s books last year.Auditors also noted that $38 742 and $24 297,92 relating to the housing account and the union s main account respectively, could not be accounted for.A report was then made to the police. This resulted in ZDTU suspending its interim president Mr George Mushipe and his entire national executive.Other members of the national executive that were suspended included Mrs Gillian Mugweni (interim vice-president), L Karimatsenga (interim treasurer) and eight others. ZDTU secretary general Mr Timothy Chinyadza yesterday confirmed that the police were investigating members of the executive. Last month we made a decision to suspend them to ensure that they do not interfere with police investigations regarding missing funds at the union; and for the part they played in engaging in dubious housing deals, which fleeced members of their hard earned cash and for failure to provide services to members as promised, he said.Mr Chinyadza said the executive members had also been failing to respect and follow the union s constitution by making unilateral decisions. Poor and corrupt governance is evidenced by disregard for simple principles of accounting and failure to produce receipts for large sums of money such as $4 500 after making payments to supposed creditors, he said. Surprisingly, receipts for small amounts such as $10 for fuel would be produced by the same individuals. Mr Chinyadza said they were consulting with provinces and will announce an acting national executive soon.
