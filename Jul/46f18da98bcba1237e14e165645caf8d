Arsene WengerLONDON. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has made yet more history, with the Frenchman now the longest serving manager of the English Premier League soccer era after surpassing Sir Alex Ferguson. On Monday, Wenger took his number of days in charge of Arsenal to 7 583 exactly one day longer than Sir Alex spent in charge of the Red Devils after the top-tier of English football had been rebranded as the Premier League. Sir Alex took over at Old Trafford in 1986 when they were in the old First Division, with the Premier League not coming into being until the 1992/93 season.Wenger arrived at Arsenal four years later, taking over at the Emirates in September 1996 after Bruce Rioch s dismissal, leaving Japanese side Nagoya Grampus Eight to take over the Gunners. That means Wenger still has some six years to go until he will match Ferguson s total United tenure, with the Scot having sat in the Old Trafford dugout for 9 704 days. Metro.
