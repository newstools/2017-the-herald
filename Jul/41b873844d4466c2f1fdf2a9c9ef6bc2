Oriental Quarries Boxing Promotions, who are Manyuchi s handlers, were co-hosting the event as they joined hands with Exodus Boxing Academy and Mitanda Boxing Promotions.Speaking to The Herald yesterday Manyuchi said he had a good fight, but acknowledged his opponent was also up to the task. I won on points, it was a unanimous judges decision. My opponent was good, he is from DRC and he is just like me, they got him to join Exodus Boxing Academy (from Zambia). He once challenged me and we finally met and I beat him convincingly. I am down, but definitely not out and I am going back to where I was before, said Manyuchi.Manyuchi succumbed to a surprise first round knock-out to Qudratillo Abduqaxorov in Singapore in March and now has to fight his way back to the top.Sunday s fight was his first since that defeat in Singapore.
