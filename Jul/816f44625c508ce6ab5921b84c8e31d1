On my part, I had already accepted the decision but as a leader and, at the same time, fighter, I have the moral obligation to uphold sportsmanship, truth and fairness in the eyes of the public. I love boxing and I don t wanna see it dying because of (an) unfair decision and officiating. - BBC Sport.&nbsp;
