LONDON. Wimbledon has ramped up security following the recent wave of terror attacks in London, chief executive Richard Lewis said as the prestigious tennis tournament got underway yesterday. Under-cover surveillance spotters, firearms officers and protective barriers are in place to protect the two-week tournament, which typically sees around 40 000 people per day visiting the site.Barriers have been placed along the route into Wimbledon, following vehicle-based terror attacks on pedestrians this year on bridges in central London. They have been put in based upon a recommendation by the security service because of the recent terrorist attacks, Lewis told reporters at the All England Club. There s an increase in surveillance from the security services and ourselves. There s other increased measures in place but most of them are below the radar, he said, refusing to divulge details for security reasons.Lewis said the players were comfortable with the level of security.
