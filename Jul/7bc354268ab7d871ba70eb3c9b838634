The 16-year-old is a member of ZIFA Northern Region side Herentals, which is owned by his family.His father, Innocent, still plays for Herentals. Now at Peterhouse, the youngster started as a goalkeeper in primary school but later moved to midfield. Oliver Chirega, the Herentals team manager, said they were happy with the teenager s progress. We are happy with his call-up and we hope it is a good experience for him. He has been playing soccer all his life and it does not come as much of a surprise to us. He managed to break into the Peterhouse first team this season and it is very difficult for a Form Four student to break into that team. The youngster can use both legs and is able to pack some good shots and is good at set pieces, said Chirega.Benza is nicknamed Zizou by his teammates at Herentals while at Peterhouse they call him Benzo.
