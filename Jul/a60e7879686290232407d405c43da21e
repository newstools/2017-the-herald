Jose MourinhoMANCHESTER. &#8211; Jose Mourinho is unhappy at the lack of movement on Manchester United signings this summer, Sky Sports sources understand. The United manager wants to conclude a deal for Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata this week with the first-team squad set to begin training at Carrington on Saturday.Representatives for Morata met with Real Madrid on Monday morning to discuss the striker s future. Mourinho identified four key positions where United needed to strengthen to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward at the start of the summer, but the club have so far only brought in defender Victor Lindelof ahead of embarking on a pre-season tour of the US on Sunday.While Mourinho would like signings in place before the three-week trip, United are having to wait on other clubs to bring in replacements before allowing players to leave.Chelsea are in talks to sign Monaco midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko and a conclusion to the deal could unlock the door for Nemanja Matic to reunite with former boss Mourinho at Old Trafford.While United are in need of additional striker options, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic having been released following a long-term injury and Wayne Rooney s future uncertain, Morata s move to United could also rest on Real Madrid bringing in another forward.Rooney is unlikely to be allowed to leave United until forward options are brought in, though Everton have not ruled out a deal for the 31-year-old.Any agreement to see Rooney return to Goodison Park is expected to be on loan, with United needing to pay some of the forward s wages. &#8211; Sky Sports.
