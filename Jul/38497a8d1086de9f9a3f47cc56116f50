Church rituals were done starting from the doorstep where he was asked to remove his shoes and went inside the room called Ngarava. The evangelist prayed and promised him that the case would be dealt with in the Politburo but no decision would be made with regards to the case by the President. Cde Kasukuwere was rejected by nine out of the 10 Zanu-PF provinces.A probe team chaired by Advocate Jacob Mudenda found Cde Kasukuwere guilty on the many charges he was facing including fanning factionalism in provinces, corruption and abuse of office.
