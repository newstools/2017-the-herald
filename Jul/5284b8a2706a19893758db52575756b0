We are expecting a bumper attendance at this winter camp. The stage is set and at least 300 participants have already confirmed their presence at the seminar. We have invited the Director Anti-Doping Agency and Research for Kenya, Agnes Wanjiku Mandu, to be the guest speaker. She will be accompanied by her colleague Thomas Kipkemboi. Besides the Kenyan pair, there will be a lot of presenters like More Moyo and the SRC s Joseph Muchechetere. Stakeholders from different sectors are coming for the event and we intend to inculcate teamwork and share ideas in a relaxed atmosphere, he said.Mhiribidi said interest in the programme was growing. The initiative has grown in leaps and bounds since 2011. We held our first winter camp with only five delegates in attendance and but here we are now.
