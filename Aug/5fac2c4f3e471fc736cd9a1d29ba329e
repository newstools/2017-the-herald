Now we are happy we won this game as we were looking forward to this game, said Dube. The veteran forward has been praised by Mapeza in many post-match interviews saying his coming on board has brought stability to the team. Wadi said although his new team lost, he was happy they gave as much as they got in the contest. Actually I can t complain, it was a great feeling, great game, he said. Of course, we had our chances and they also had theirs but they utilised them but we didn t utilise ours. I was not under any pressure playing against them, it was just a normal game. The coach told me to just go and play my normal game, so it was fine.
