SYDNEY. Coach Steve Hansen has vowed to tighten the noose around the Wallabies for this week s potentially deciding Bledisloe Cup Test after venting his frustration over the All Blacks ugly finish to their Sydney romp. The world rugby champion New Zealanders put the Wallabies to the sword in a point-a-minute opening half before losing focus to finish record 54-34 winners in the Rugby Championship opener on Saturday.The All Blacks feasted on the Australians feeble defence to run in eight tries, but allowed the Wallabies to score four late tries after leading 54-6 and with a record winning margin beckoning.While it was New Zealand s biggest score over Australia, eclipsing their 51-20 win in Auckland three years ago, Hansen demanded more from his players ahead of Saturday s home Test in Dunedin, where they have only lost once to Australia in 12 encounters. The first 50 minutes was probably as good rugby as you will see, the last 30 minutes was probably some of the ugliest rugby, Hansen told reporters after Saturday s win. AFP.
