Institutions like the AU cannot rely on donor funding as the model is not sustainable. This humble gesture on Zimbabwe s part has no universal application but it demonstrates what is possible when people apply their minds to tasks before them. The Sadc summit is also expected to focus on measures to improve food security in the region, in particular how to strengthen implementation of the Regional Agricultural Policy that aims to improve production, productivity, competitiveness and trade in the agricultural sector, natural resources and environment.Another topical issue expected to be discussed by summit would be the proposed new structure of the Sadc Secretariat.President Mugabe was welcomed at the Waterkloof Airport by South African ICT Minister Siyabonga Cwele, Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, who was already here, and Zimbabwe s Ambassador to South Africa Isiaah Moyo
