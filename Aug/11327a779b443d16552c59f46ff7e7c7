Registration for participants closed yesterday afternoon.A Tag Rugby Zimbabwe Trust representative said their aim was to help people understand the sport. The event is targeted at helping people get active in a fun and social forum playing non-contact rugby. Prior to registration we had 60 places up for grabs to create a six-team tournament of 10 members each. The aim is create an environment of enjoyment, exercise, laughter as well as getting people from different backgrounds come together. This event is a pilot programme (we ve never done it before) but this is the best method we have found to launch our programmes with. Some funds raised will go towards the development the children s careers.
