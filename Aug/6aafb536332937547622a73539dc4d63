Wayne RooneyLIVERPOOL. Wayne Rooney said it doesn t get much better than firing Everton to victory after waiting more than 13 years to score for his boyhood club once again. Having enjoyed a record-breaking, medal-laden stint at Old Trafford, the 31-year-old this summer returned to Goodison Park in search of regular first-team football.Rooney was thrown in from the outset in Everton s English Premier League opener on Saturday and did not disappoint, with his header late in the first half enough to secure a 1-0 victory against Stoke. On a personal level scoring the winning goal at Goodison Park is a special moment, England s all-time top scorer told broadcasters after the match. It doesn t get much better. To play for this club is a huge deal for me. The early games in the season are always tough because you are always finding your rhythm in games. ESPN.
