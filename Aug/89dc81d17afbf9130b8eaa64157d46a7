This loss is not for the people Gutu alone or Masvingo Province alone, but a loss for Zimbabwe as a whole. Sen Mahofa carried the aspirations of the people of Masvingo and in fact I must say she was Masvingo herself and allow me to pay tribute to President Mugabe and our party Zanu-PF for conferring national heroine status on her, he said. I want to tell you that the decision to confer national heroine status was one of the easiest jobs ever because her track record speaks for itself. Her loss to the people of Masvingo is like the roof of the house that has been taken off. Cde Chipanga challenged the Zanu-PF leadership and members in Masvingo to pay homage to the national heroine by making sure the ruling party retains all the 26 House of Assembly seats in next year s harmonised elections.Cde Chipanga said Masvingo was a key Zanu-PF stronghold and produced luminaries like the late Vice President Simon Muzenda, Cde Eddison Zvobgo, Retired Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai, Rtd General Vitalis Zvinavashe, among others.Zanu-PF Masvingo provincial chairman Cde Ezra Chadzamira said it would be very difficult for the province without Sen Mahofa s guidance, but urged party cadres to soldier on. It will be very difficult for us the people of Masvingo to go into 2018 without Sen Mahofa, who was our mentor, teacher and a unifying force who will be solely missed, he said. The good thing, however, is that Sen Mahofa left a clear framework on where the province should go with impending socio-economic transformation hinged on the recently completed Tokwe-Mukosi Dam and the Beitbridge-Harare Highway dualisation project, he said.Sen Mahofa s body lay in state at her Mpandawana home yesterday.The body would be flown to Harare, where it will lie in state at her Greendale home before burial at the National Heroes Acre tomorrow.Sen Mahofa was born in 1941 in Chivi.She attended Chibi Mission and Morgenster Mission schools.Sen Mahofa enrolled for a nurse training course at Morgenster Mission where she attained a Diploma inNursing between 1958 and 1960.In 1973 she enrolled for a Diploma in Community Development at Domboshava Training Centre and was active in early nationalist politics that saw her joining the United National Democratic Party.
