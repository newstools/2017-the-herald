VP MphokoFarirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter&#8212; Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko has warned against taking politics emotionally saying such an approach resulted in political violence. VP Mphoko, who is also the minister responsible for national healing, said this during Senate s question and answer time yesterday while responding to Matabeleland South Senator Sithembile Mlotshwa on what the Ministry of National Healing was doing to curb political violence ahead of next year s elections. Fighting comes from attitudes. We have a responsibility not to take politics as (the) one that runs our lives. The moment you take politics as a profession you risk going wrong, he said.VP Mphoko also said politicians had a responsibility to lead their followers by example. He said the problem of political violence lay with politicians themselves. The problem is not within the ministry (National Healing), the problem is with us politicians, he added.President Mugabe has on numerous occasions condemned political violence saying it has no place in the country s political fabric.Meanwhile, VP Mphoko has defended chiefs for voting alongside zanu-pf on various issues in Senate.He was responding to a question by MDC-T Manicaland Senator David Chimhini who wanted to know the rationale for chiefs actions as the constitution says they must be apolitical. A chief is a human being. When he votes he is not whipped by a political party. He votes as a person, there is nobody who is hanging (isolated) up there in this world, he said.
