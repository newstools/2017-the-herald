MADRID. Real Madrid needed a late strike from Marco Asensio to prevent a shock defeat, but still saw their relentless winning streak ended by Valencia in a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

I can t be happy with the result, but the performance was excellent and we deserved more today, said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane. That s football, you can t always win. We ve lost two points, but I am very proud of my players.Valencia have endured two dreadful years, finishing 12th for the past two seasons, but there were further encouraging signs of a revival under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral after their opening day win over Las Palmas. It was a great spectacle, said Marcelino. A draw was a fair result, although either side could have won. I am sure the fans will be proud of their players.
