It s only then that we would take the necessary conclusions with the executive committee, he said before adding that there is always a plan B . Plan B is to open tender procedures so that there are other (countries) participating in the organisation, said Ahmad without elaborating. A number of countries, including Morocco and Algeria, have said they are ready to host the 2019 event. AFP
