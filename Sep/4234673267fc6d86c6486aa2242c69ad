LONDON. – Alexandre Lacazette has warned Arsenal not to “get carried away” after their recent upturn in English Premier League form. After a slow start to the season that saw them take just three points from their opening three matches, which included an embarrassing 4-0 defeat by Liverpool, Arsenal have gone unbeaten in September, picking up seven points. That tally included a battling goalless draw at champions Chelsea, and following Monday night’s 2-0 win over West Brom, Lacazette told SFR Sport that the squad were always confident they could turn things round. “I didn’t feel any sense of panic in particular,” Lacazette, who scored both goals against West Brom, said. “We knew our work would pay off and that’s what’s happened. But we mustn’t get carried away, we have to keep going like this. “We’re still not perfect, but we had a lot of possession, we didn’t concede and we managed to score. We feel we can still do better, but it’s good.” The summer signing from Lyon added: “We’re unbeaten in September, we’ve remobilised defensively. The whole team is working for each other, that’s what makes the difference.” Lacazette’s brace against West Brom means he has now scored in each of his three home matches for his new club, an Arsenal first since Brian Marwood achieved the feat in 1988. “Someone told me about that,” Lacazette said. “It’s anecdotal, it’s not the kind of record I look for. I’m not looking for records, I’m rather looking for stability with the team, and we saw tonight that it’s going better and better.” The France international received a warm ovation from the Emirates Stadium crowd when he was replaced eight minutes from time. “It’s great to have the public behind you, it gives you confidence,” he said. “I’d like to thank them for the faith they have in me.” – ESPN.
