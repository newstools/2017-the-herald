Antonio Conte LONDON. – AC Milan have contacted Chelsea manager about replacing under-fire manager Vincenzo Montella, according to reports in Italy. AC Milan spent in excess of £170million on new recruits in the summer but have endured a mixed start to the season as they sit sixth in Serie A. And Italian media outlet Gazzetta dello Sport claim manager Montella, who took charge in June 2016, is already under pressure after just 10 games of the new season. Montella is said to have the next two games to save his job against rivals Roma and Inter Milan. Milan’s wealthy owners have apparently made contact with Chelsea boss Conte and Bayern Munich manager Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti spent five years at Milan during his playing career and another eight years as their manager, winning 15 honours in the process. While Conte enjoyed a successful three years in charge of Juventus before spells at Italy and now Chelsea, winning Serie A in each of his seasons in charge. Conte, who won the Premier League in his first season at Chelsea, this week admitted he plans to return Italy at some point in the future. Conte revealed he misses his native Italy and plans to return home soon. “Yes, I miss Italy. And in my mind, there’s no doubt I will be home before long,” Conte said in an interview on Monday with Italian radio station Anch’io Sport. “Italy is my homeland, so once I have had some good experiences, important and life-changing experiences, I’ll be back. I don’t know when but that’s the aim.” The 48-year-old from Lecce in the heel of Italy led Chelsea to the Premier League title in his first season in England. “For me, it was my first year abroad and it was great to win at the first attempt. A special feeling was created with the fans,” he said. – The Daily Express.
