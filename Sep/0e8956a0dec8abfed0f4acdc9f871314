LUSAKA. – Zambia’s immigration authorities have arrested 16 foreigners and three locals in a suspected human trafficking syndicate, an immigration spokesperson said yesterday. Among those arrested in one of the suburbs of Lusaka, the country’s capital, were 15 Ethiopians, three Zambians and a Tanzanian, according to Immigration Department spokesperson Namati Nshinka. He said immigration officers launched the raid in Matero East suburb on Monday following information from the public indicating an impending movement of the Ethiopians through the country’s southern border. The spokesperson added that the suspects were found hidden in one of the vehicles at a house where the Ethiopians were staying. According to him, it was established that one of the vehicles was the same one that evaded officers during another operation earlier this month which resulted in the arrest of 15 Ethiopians and the suspected mastermind, a Zambian, who was also suspected to be the owner of the house. – Xinhua.
