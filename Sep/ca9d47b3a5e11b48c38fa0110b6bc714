The appointment of the Commission follows the mushrooming of illegal settlements in most urban areas, most of which were established from the illegal sale of State land by land barons.This has led to demolitions of residential structures in the past prejudicing ordinary people of their hard earned money.Most of the settlements do not have water and sewer reticulation and other infrastructure such as roads, electricity, schools and clinics.
