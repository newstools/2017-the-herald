LONDON. Joe Root believes England have the capacity to do something special by retaining the Ashes in Australia, after they wrapped up a 2-1 Test cricket series victory against West Indies at Lord s on Saturday. A nine-wicket win inside three days at the home of cricket meant England had won both of Root s first two series as captain following a preceding 3-1 home triumph over South Africa.Saturday s success was effectively sealed by James Anderson taking his Test-best figures after all-rounder Ben Stokes starred with both ball and bat. Having become the first Englishman and only sixth bowler to reach the milestone of 500 Test wickets on Friday, Anderson went on to record innings figures of seven for 42 in a West Indies total of 177 all out.That left England requiring a mere 107 to win.
