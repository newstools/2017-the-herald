Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter THEY might not have won the tournament at this year’s edition of the COSAFA Women’s Championship, but the Mighty Warriors still showed they are a force to be reckoned with in the region. Two of their players — Rutendo Makore and Chido Dzingirai — won the Golden Boot and Goalkeeper of the Year awards. Dzingirai said it was a great achievement to win the Golden glove award. “I am happy to have been the best goalkeeper out of the 12 countries. It’s a great achievement in my life and I don’t have to relax. “It’s time to work even harder so that I will collect more (awards),” said Dzingirai. Dzingirai was part of the 2011 group which lifted the trophy at Rufaro. “We have to accept as it is because it’s part of the game, sometimes you lose and sometimes you win. We just have to keep the momentum as a team,” Dzingirai said. Her teammate Makore also rose to the occasion providing 10 goals for her side, helping the team reach the final of the competition. “I told myself that in this tournament I have to be the top goal scorer. I am really happy because that was my wish during camp. “And I want to thank my teammates, the technical team and also the fans, without them maybe I would not have scored. “If you look at the game against Zambia, first half we were down but then in the second half the supporters really helped us, they were there to support us. “They had confidence in us that we will win although it did not go our away,” Makore said. The Mighty Warriors forward said it is pleasing to note that most countries are investing in the development of women football with countries such as Malawi, Botswana and Lesotho presenting some good challenge during the tournament. “What I discovered is that there are no smaller teams anymore because Lesotho beat Namibia, Botswana drew against South Africa and we drew against Malawi.”
