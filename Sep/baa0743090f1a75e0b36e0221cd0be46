LONDON. – Zimbabwe-born British boxer Dereck Chisora will challenge Agit Kabayel for the German’s EBU heavyweight title in Monte Carlo on November 4. Chisora will hope to win the belt for the second time, having previously held it from September 2013 to November 2014. The 33-year-old will fight on the undercard of the WBA world light-heavyweight title fight between Dmitry Bivol and Trent Broadhurst, which co-headlines the Monte-Carlo Boxing Bonanza show. Also co-headling the bill, organised by Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn, is the WBA world bantamweight title bout between holder Jamie McDonnell and Liborio Solis. The two fighters fought for the belt on last year’s event at the Salle des Etoiles, with Englishman McDonnell beating the Venezuelan by unanimous decision. Scott Quigg is also in action in Monaco in November against Oleg Yefimovych, with more bouts to be announced in the coming weeks. The Bivol v Broadhurst light-heavyweight title showdown will be televised in the US on HBO Boxing After Dark. Bivol defends his WBA title against Australian Broadhurst with the exciting 26-year-old looking to add another KO to his impressive record. The Russian’s fearsome reputation continues to grow and picked up the crown in just his seventh pro fight, and has wowed crowds in his homeland and the US, and will be out to impress in his first fight in front of the Sky Sports cameras. Broadhurst has been on a fine run of his own though, and the 29-year-old Queenslander is aiming to add to the feel-good factor in boxing Down Under and take his golden opportunity with both hands. McDonnell and Solis shared a great fight in Monte-Carlo last November with the Doncaster ace holding onto his crown by a slender margin on points against a spirited challenge from the Venezuelan, one that earned Solis an immediate return – but McDonnell expects to be a clear winner second time round with the carrot of some big domestic bouts dangling in front of him. - Boxing News.
