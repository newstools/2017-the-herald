SINGAPORE. &#8211; Lewis Hamilton warned the Formula One championship was far from over after Ferrari s first-lap disaster in Singapore put him in the driving seat for his fourth world title. The Mercedes driver said he was expecting a strong response from Ferrari after both Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen went out after a crash at the first corner.Hamilton had laboured in qualifying, starting from fifth, but he drove brilliantly in the wet and under lights to open up a potentially decisive 28-point lead over Vettel in the standings. The 32-year-old Briton has now won the last three races, but he said there was still a long way to go with six grands prix left in the season, starting with Malaysia next week. Honestly, I think it s going to be very close in the next races, he said, warning that Ferrari would be particularly strong in Japan and Brazil. It s hard to predict. Hamilton was one of only 12 drivers to finish the first wet race on the floodlit streets of Singapore, which started with a game-changing smash and saw three safety cars. Pole-sitter Vettel and third-placed Raikkonen sandwiched Red Bull s Max Verstappen going into the first corner, resulting in a crash which took out all three and also ended the race of McLaren s Fernando Alonso. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
