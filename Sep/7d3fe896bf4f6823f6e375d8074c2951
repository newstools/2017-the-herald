FIFA have nullified the result of South Africa s 2018 World Cup qualifier against Senegal, which Bafana Bafana won 2-1 in November last year, and ordered a replay of the game in November this year. Bafana Bafana won that match 2-1 but it was marred by controversy after Ghanaian referee Joseph Lamptey awarded the South Africans a controversial penalty which they converted for their winning goal.Lamptey has since been handed a life-time ban by FIFA from all football-related activities after he was found guilty of having manipulated the outcome of that match.Senegal launched a protest, just after the match, and FIFA have been reviewing the case. The Bureau for the FIFA World Cup qualifiers ordered a replay of the qualification match between South Africa and Senegal held on 12 November 2016, FIFA said in a statement yesterday. This decision follows the confirmation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to uphold the lifetime ban of match referee, Joseph Lamptey, for match manipulation, the ruling imposed by the FIFA Disciplinary and Appeal Committees.
