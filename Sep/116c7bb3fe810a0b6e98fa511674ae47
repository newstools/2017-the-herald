BERLIN. Robert Lewandowski netted twice on his 100th German Bundesliga soccer appearance for Bayern Munich who brushed off their internal strife with a 4-0 hammering of Mainz on Saturday. We played really well and controlled the game from the first minute, said Lewandowski.Everything worked out like we had planned it. When we re so flexible on the pitch, it makes it hard for any opponent to stop us. Lewandowski has now netted 82 goals for Munich amidst reports he wants to join Real Madrid next season, but Bayern chairman Uli Hoeness laughed off the claim by Spanish newspaper AS. It s not April 1, quipped Bayern boss to broadcaster Sport1.The rout left Bayern second in Germany s top flight, a point behind Hanover 96, who claimed the lead after four games with a 2-0 win over Hamburg on Friday.
