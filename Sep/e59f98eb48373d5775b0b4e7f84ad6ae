Tedious Manyepo Sports Reporter THE country’s basketball fraternity has been plunged into mourning following the death of respected former Basketball Union of Zimbabwe chairperson, Kimon Raftopoulos, who passed away on Monday night. The veteran administrator, who was also diabetic, succumbed to cancer in Harare on Monday night at the age of 69. Raftopoulos was one of the non-white pioneers of basketball in the country and, together with his late wife, Juliat, co-founded Arcadia Bucs which was one of the best teams during its heydays. The Harare Basketball Association led the tributes yesterday with its president Sunny Mbofana describing Raftopoulos as a legend of the game. “It’s indeed a very sad chapter in Zimbabwean basketball fraternity. We have lost a giant and authority of the game in Raftopoulos (Kimon). “We have lost a father and proponent of this beautiful game. Our deepest condolences as the Harare Basketball Association go to his family, Arcadia Bucs and the Zimbabwean basketball community,” he said in a statement. Current Arcadia Bucs coach Craig Manuel, who is also a nephew to the late administrator, said the void left by Raftopoulos will be difficult to fill. “We respect him as he was one of the pioneers of basketball in the country. ‘‘We will miss his touch, advice and guidance,” he said. Raftopoulos assumed the BUZ chairpersonship in 1988 after the incumbent Edgar Rogers had decided against seeking re-election. He is survived by two sons Creon (42) and Reno (37) and as many grandchildren. Creon is one of the most respected coaches in England. Burial arrangements for the late basketball leader will be announced in due course as the family was by last night still waiting for other close relatives to arrive from India.
