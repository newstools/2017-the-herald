LONDON. Memories of the chasing England were given by France s Kylian Mbappe and Ousmane Dembele remain fresh in Harry Kane s mind as he contemplates his side s path to the World Cup. England are on course to secure a ticket to Russia ahead of today s qualifier against Malta in Ta Qali, but recent friendly games have laid bare the extent to which they trail behind the global elite.In June, the brilliance of Mbappe and Dembele enabled France to weather the mid-game dismissal of Raphael Varane and beat England 3-2 at Stade de France, but rather than being cowed, Kane was inspired. I don t think it s daunting, the Tottenham Hotspur striker told reporters at England s St George s Park headquarters this week. At the end of the day, we only lost 3-2. I know they were down to 10 men for the majority of the second half. I don t think we re that far away. We re a little bit behind at the minute. France are an extremely good team with a lot of good players to choose from, but so are we. The most important thing for us now is to qualify for the World Cup and we can do that by winning the next two games. If that s done and dusted then we can really start preparing. England are two points clear at the top of UEFA Group F and can take a giant step towards qualification by beating minnows Malta and then defeating closest rivals Slovakia at Wembley on Monday.Gareth Southgate s side would be even closer to their objective had it not been for a chaotic finish to their last group game against Scotland in June, when Kane s stoppage-time equaliser rescued a 2-2 draw.Including the Hampden stalemate, England have won just one of their last five matches.
