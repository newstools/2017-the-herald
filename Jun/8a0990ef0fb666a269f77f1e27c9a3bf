Tedious Manyepo Sports Reporter IN-FORM Black Rhinos goalkeeper Hebert Rusawo has revealed the pain of being overlooked for the Warriors squad for the COSAFA Castle Cup. Rusawo has been the best performing keeper in the domestic Premiership this season with 10 clean sheets and two goals, including one against Highlanders. I respect the coach s decision. Whoever is chosen ahead of me deserves it and it is the duty of all of us as Zimbabweans to support all those players for the good of the country. I know that at the moment I have picked the form of my life and I am performing wonders, but I have to stay grounded and continue to better my game. It is every player s dream to be part of the Warriors, but I have to respect the coaches for their decision. I really expected to be selected, but then, well my time will also come and at the moment I have to support those who have been chosen, he said.The 2013 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League Goalkeeper of the Year said he will continue working hard to help Rhinos reclaim their past glory. Coach Stanford Stix Mtizwa and his men face a resurgent Harare City and Rusawo believes his side has the pedigree to outwit their opponents. We are all aware that it is still early days to talk of the league title, but if we keep the spirit that we have shown so far, I think we could have a say in the destiny of the championship. This year s competition is stiff with Dynamos, Ngezi Platinum, How Mine, Chicken Inn and ZPC Kariba all showing their class. As Rhinos our priority is to avoid relegation, but who knows, if can keep the momentum we can as well be changing our tone come end of the season, he said.
