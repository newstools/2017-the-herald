VP Mphoko and Dr Mbambo once served as ambassadors at the same time in Russia.Speaking after the meeting, Dr Mbambo said they were in Zimbabwe to gain experience on increasing agricultural yields. I had a pleasant experience, he said. We are here to learn about food production in Zimbabwe. We have started with a small project back home, Operation Termites it is called. You are aware that termites work hard before winter to store their food. We thought it was wise to come to Zimbabwe to learn more about how to produce, but also as friends and comrades who fought with us in the first phase of the liberation struggle who can be better to help us in the second phase that is economic emancipation. We are again in the same war, but this time against poverty and hunger to empower our people to be self-reliant. VP Mphoko said he had good relations with Dr Mbambo during their stay in Russia. We served together and during our time there. We had a nice time, he said. We were regarded as Sadc mafia group of ambassadors. Our stint in Russia was excellent because we were a combination of experienced people. He left earlier and I went to India and South Africa. He came back as Governor and I came back as Vice President. We have a lot to reminisce.
