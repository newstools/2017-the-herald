Fans must come and watch the only true remaining derby in Zimbabwe and we are praying for the better team to win and fans must respect the referee s decisions. We are brothers from one family and tomorrow we will be in an exam. Each one of us will be in his own corner writing the exam and we will shake hands when the results come out. As Shabanie we are going to play the match in the true spirit of the derby and we do not want any form of violence, he said.FC Platinum assistant coach Lizwe Sweswe, who took charge of the team s preparations this week in the absence of head coach Norman Mapeza who was in Harare with the Warriors, said they were ready for the big match. It is a big match for the mining town, neighbouring Mberengwa and other parts of Zimbabwe. We need maximum points on the day and people will enjoy the 90 minutes on Sunday. We want people to come and watch exciting football. We are gunning for maximum points even though Shabanie Mine have improved and are now organised since we last beat them in the CG Msipa Trust match. We are raring to go and the good thing is we are injury free, said Sweswe.
