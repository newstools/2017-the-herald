LOS ANGELES. &#8211; Boxing hall of famer Lennox Lewis won t be spending his money on the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight, saying he can t take it serious because the outcome is too predictable. The former undisputed world heavyweight champion said the combination of Mayweather s boxing experience and hand speed will be too much to handle for McGregor, who has made him name as a mixed martial arts fighter. It s ridiculous to me, Lewis told US sports broadcaster ESPN. You are talking about one discipline where you can use only your hands and only a few can do it. Every battle sport always starts with your hands, but they are two totally different sports. The fight is being held in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and promoters are hoping to make millions off the pay-per-view sales. Scheduled as a 12-round boxing match with 10 ounce gloves, three-time world heavyweight champion Lewis says it won t go the distance. Mayweather is the best in his weight class, no one can touch him in boxing. Floyd will stop him. He s just too good at boxing for McGregor and McGregor is just too inexperienced. I wouldn t buy it &#8211; but I would be interested in the result. To me, I know who is going to win already so there s no use in watching it. Lewis said.- AFP.
