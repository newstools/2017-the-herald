Collen Murahwa Herald Reporter Petro Trade yesterday donated $1 000 worth of groceries to Jairos Jiri School of the Blind in Kadoma. The goodies include sugar, cooking oil and salt.Speaking during the ceremony, Petro Trade retail manager Mrs Emilda Kasima said they decided to embark on this corporate social responsibility programme after realising the needs of the institution. We feel humbled by the work you are doing here and, indeed, the spirit of Jairos Jiri is still here with us, she said. We as an organisation are here to complement the work that was started by Jairos Jiri and Government efforts to empower the less privileged and the disabled. Mrs Kasima urged other businesses to take a cue from the trend they set in order to improve the lives of the underprivileged. We are thankful to God for encouraging us to extend this gesture and we are encouraging other businesses to also donate towards the upkeep of organisations like Jairos Jiri, she said. What we have realised here is that if these children are nurtured in a conducive environment like this, they can do exceptionally well and can positively influence the community. Speaking at the same occasion, the national executive director for Jairos Jiri, Mr Wilson Ruvere, applauded Petro Trade for the donation. In these difficult times, we are greatly appreciative to people who are raised by the Lord to bless the underprivileged, he said. Life these days has become very individualistic but Petro Trade has shown us that there are still good people out there who care for the plight of others. Mrs Christina Chagwiza of Jairos Jiri, however, said the institution required more computers since it relied on computers as learning aids. We have an enrolement of 136 students and we are appealing to corporates and individuals to donate more computers and speakers since our students use them as learning aids, she said.
