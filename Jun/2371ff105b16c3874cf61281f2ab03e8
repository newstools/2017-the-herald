OAKLAND. &#8211; Kevin Durant came to Golden State looking for a basketball championship and found a band of brothers who, as it turned out, were exactly what he needed to finally capture that long-sought title. After rocking the NBA last year with his decision to leave Oklahoma City as a free agent and sign with the Warriors, Durant s dream came true on Monday night when Golden State beat Cleveland 129-120 to win the best-of-seven NBA Finals four games to one. To have teammates that encourage you, that lift you up, that s what we all need in life, he said. It was amazing to just see that all year, and right now just to be here with these guys, it s amazing. Durant was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player after averaging 35.2 points and 8.4 rebounds a game, and he became the first player since Shaquille O Neal in 2000 to make 30 or more points in five finals games. You ve got to call Kevin Durant a champion now, Warriors guard and two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry said. I m just so happy for him to be able to realize his goal and be my teammate. - AFP.
