Walter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau Parliamentarians have called for the speedy computerisation and integration of the country s transport management system to reduce road carnage attributable to human error and unroadworthy vehicles. Coupled with the establishment of stabilisation centres along the country s major roads for initial care before one is taken to the hospital, computerisation will manage the human causative factor in accidents.Experts say more than 70 percent of deaths in an accident are a result of people failing to get initial attention to stabilise them, especially in the first hour known as the Golden Hour .It has been established that more than 80 percent of road accidents are a result of human error.The call by legislators comes at a time when 44 people died and 33 others were injured in the Nyamakate bus accident on Wednesday after the driver of a Zambia-bound King Lion bus veered off the road at a curve and crashed into a tree.About 29 of the 44 bodies, which are all at Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital mortuary, have so far been positively identified.In an interview, chairman of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructure Cde Dexter Nduna said computerisation would ensure that police got information on the suitability of the driver, his vehicle and other important information. We commend Government for taking the initial step in putting a stabilisation ambulance at Ngundu Halt, he said. That process has to be intensified. We, however, feel that the integration of the road motor transport management system coming up with a database of Zinara, VID and the police will help reduce carnage. The database will ensure that information on the suitability of a driver, including being above 25 years, with a defensive driver s licence and vehicle fitness is readily available, especially at road- blocks.Cde Nduna said provisions in the military that prescribe that four hours of continuous driving should be proceeded by two hours rest were worth of universal enforcement.
