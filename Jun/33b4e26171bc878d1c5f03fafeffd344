Business Reporter Listed cement manufacturer, Lafarge Holcim Zimbabwe said protection measures introduced by Government against cement imports last year have been instrumental in easing pressure on local players. The introduction of protection measures came after local cement producers had warned of possible scaling down of operations and closures owing to an influx of cheap imported products fromLafarge Holcim Zimbabwe chief executive Amal Tantawi told The Herald Business last week that the cement manufacturer welcomes competition in the industry but cheap imports had been a threat. In 2016, the Government introduced an industry protection tariff which has eased some of the pressure related to cement imports. The local industry cannot compete with cement imports. Continued importation of cement can affect industry and lead to closure of business and loss of jobs. The company welcomes and views competition as healthy for both our business and our customers, said Mrs Tantawi. Competition presents opportunities for innovative thinking and providing quality service to our customer. Competition also allows us to continue to innovate and truly understand the needs of our customers, she said.The country s main producers; Lafarge, PPC Cement and Sino Cement last year had installed capacity of 1,85 tonnes against demand of 1,17 tonnes.Mrs Tantawi said the local cement manufacturers have adequate capacity to meet the demand which is the reason why continued investment in improving productivity for the local manufacturers remains important.She said Lafarge as an individual player is committed to doing further investments in Zimbabwe. Lafarge Cement has been the cement of choice in this market over the past 60 years. We remain committed to providing value added services to our consumers and well always provide a quality product to the market.
