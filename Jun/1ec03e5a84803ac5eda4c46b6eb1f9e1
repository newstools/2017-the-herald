Makomborero Marumisa &#8211; OyOsTech News The evolution of the music industry has led us to the birth of online music streaming and online purchasing from music stores, bringing with it a new way to curb the greatest enemy of all serious artists slaving away in a recording studio piracy. While the never-ending battle against piracy rages on, the fight has seen recent twists as online stores have re-invented the playing field altogether.How? Quite simply, their streaming ability, accessibility and their empowering capability of providing an alternative for serious fans who want to promote an artist.These are the key factors that aid in bringing piracy down to its knees so let s run through these to see how they work to counter piracy.The average 21st century pirate sits at the corner yelling out numerous deals to passers-by with their hoard of pirated DVDs and CDs strewn across the pavement, online stores on the other hand have a coverage that even they cannot beat the World Wide Web.Artists music has finally acquired the ability to reach people in their homes, on their way from work and at leisure events day or night.It has both current and old music even from the 60 s. When people are provided with insurmountable convenience the desire for pirated content is watered down.In Zimbabwe, OyOsMusic (www.OyOsMusic.co.zw) provides this outlet for people who possess a great desire for local music.The method of providing a legal, more accessible outlet has proved beneficial in curbing piracy in other countries.Apparently, since music streaming was introduced to a selected group of individuals they started opting for those sites other than illegal pirating sites or individuals.Ultimately, the scales have tipped and if word of online stores continues we might see significant change.One of the ZIMHOST Webdesigners, Ms Thelma Mutete had this to say It s good to see that people have gotten out of their comfort zone and started to move with the times, who needs Infrastructure costs when you can sale online. ZIMHOST is a 14 time ICT award winning web design company specialising in online stores and website design among other things.Online stores also ensure that consumers get exactly what they are looking for. Online stores have a feature that CDs and VCDs do not streaming.Most people admit that they are drawn to quality and since the chances of being duped buying music on the street are basically 50/50, the best alternative is to buy online.Online music stores such as OyOsMusic, possess a feature known as music streaming, which allows one to hear a sample of the song before they buy it a form of quality insurance. People who have been duped several times now can be relieved when such reliability falls on their doorstep and get the music they want anyway.Now, it s a known fact that people love sophistication. The ability to add an air of elegance to oneself.Nobody likes it when it becomes common knowledge that their entire wardrobe was sourced out from a shady corner behind a factory or a blanket rolled out across the sidewalk.It s the same thing with music. Nobody wants to be seen stuffing a collection of pirated music CDs into their purse and when you don t have enough money for a ride uptown to search more reputable outlets, online stores are often the solution.Not only do they breathe the wanton sophistication but they also help buyers who are serious about buying music. In this scenario, the winner isn t only the person who has managed to buy their favourite album but also the artist who manages to get their album sold and have something to eat at the end of the day.Overall, online stores are built with the artist in mind. It is this quality that allows the music industry to grow in different ways if things happen to continue shaping up this way we will eventually get rid of piracy in our society.Downloading music from our local reputable online stores goes a long way in promoting our music industry as a whole.ZIMHOST Webdesigners, 1st Floor, Angwa Hse, Cnr Angwa/G Silundika, 0771 111 222, 04 796528, [email&#160;protected], www.zimhosts.com
