HISTORY MAKERS . . . England Under-20 soccer team captain Lewis Cook lifts the World Cup trophy above his head after the Young Lions beat Venezuela 1-0 in the final in Suwon, South Korea, yesterday to end England s 51-year trophy drought. AFPSUWON. England ended a 51-year wait for a World Cup soccer trophy as their Under-20s side emulated the class of 66 in South Korea yesterday. England won their biggest international title since 1966 by beating Venezuela 1-0 in the Under-20 World Cup final. It was England s first appearance in the final of a global tournament since their World Cup victory 51 years ago.It may not erase 51 years of hurt, but England have a new golden generation. Paul Simpson s Under-20s are champions of the world. These are the History Boys.Dominic Calvert-Lewin is the man whose name will be written in the record books, his goal ensuring the Young Lions beat Venezuela 1-0 in South Korea, but praise must be heaped upon Freddie Woodman too, whose incredible penalty save kept England in the game.Argentina, South Korea, Costa Rica, Mexico and Italy had all fallen by the sword of St George before this one, and Venezuela were the final victims of a team that deserve every second of their success.Calvert-Lewin s rebounded effort midway through the first half was enough for England to see off Venezuela in the final in Suwon.Woodman saved Adalberto Penaranda s penalty after he controversially went down in the box.The Young Lions had reached the final after topping their group and beating off Costa Rica, Mexico and Italy in the knockout rounds.They had the lion s share of the chances in South Korea Josh Onomah hitting the crossbar.But Venezuela also had their opportunities as Ronaldo Lucena hit the post and Adalberto Penaranda fired wide from distance.The breakthrough came on 35 minutes when Everton s 20-year-old Calvert-Lewin latched on to a long ball and reacted to the save of his initial shot to squeeze home.Venezuela were forced to take pop shots form distance but Woodman proved more than a match for the efforts.The second half saw the South Americans come out strongly and were it not for two Lewis Cook clearances the scores could have been level.And they had Woodman to thank again with 20 minutes remaining when he got a strong hand to Penaranda s penalty to keep the Young Lions in front.In the first half Ronaldo Lucena hit the post with an audacious long-range free-kick that had Woodman well beaten, while Tottenham midfielder Josh Onomah saw a powerful effort strike the underside of the Venezuela bar after the break.After the match, England forward Dominic Solanke, due to join Liverpool from Chelsea on July 1, was awarded the Golden Ball given to the player of the tournament. Previous winners of the award include Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi, Luis Figo, Paul Pogba and Sergio Aguero.Woodman was awarded the Golden Glove, given to best goalkeeper of the tournament.England captain Lewis Cook, who plays for Premier League side Bournemouth, received the trophy from FIFA president Gianni Infantino before hoisting it high above his head to spark frenzied celebrations from England s Young Lions.After Calvert-Lewin s goal on 35 minutes, Cook s side withstood a ferocious second-half onslaught in Suwon, South Korea, with goalkeeper Woodman dramatically saving Adalberto Penaranda spot-kick 16 minutes from the end. We really had to battle that second half, Venezuela put us under so much pressure but the players defended for their lives, said England coach Paul Simpson. At the end of the game, when the referee blew that whistle, we knew we are the world champions, he added. We ve waited 51 years to be able to say that again as an England team. It s an incredible feeling and I don t think it will ever go away. Senior England players Harry Kane and Wayne Rooney tweeted their congratulations for the win, and former England captain Rio Ferdinand posted: Some real talent within the squad&#8230; let s give them a chance at club level! England had the better of the early exchanges with Solanke forcing a save from Wuilker Farinez and seeing a long-range effort go wide in the opening quarter of an hour.Venezuela, who have never qualified for the senior World Cup, were also making their first final appearance and took time to settle until Ronaldo Lucena s stunning free-kick hit the post in the 24th minute from 40 metres.Calvert-Lewin had already come close with a header when he scored what proved to be the winner in the 35th minute.The striker rose to beat Nahuel Ferraresi to high ball on the edge of the box and as the ball dropped his right-foot shot was parried by Farinez.He made no mistake as the rebound fell to him, coolly slotting home with his left foot at the near post.Venezuela took control after half-time as the tiny but lively substitute Yeferson Soteldo, who stands just 5ft 3in (160cm) tall, energised his side.One of his first passes sent Sergio Cordova clear but Woodman flew off his line to make a crucial save.Josh Onomah almost gave England a two-goal cushion when he ran unopposed to rattle the crossbar from distance.Venezuela by now were pouring forward and their pressure appeared to have paid off when Penaranda was brought down by Jake Clarke-Salter and the referee Bjorn Kuipers pointed to the spot, with his decision confirmed by video review.Penaranda got up to take the spot-kick only to see his effort down the middle saved as the diving Woodman flung a hand behind him, and England held out for their long-awaited World Cup win.
