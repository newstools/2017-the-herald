Range Rover EvoqueTinashe Makichi Motoring Don t let the size fool you, the Evoque is as brutal and striking as any Range Rover and since its initial launch over seven years ago it remains a stunner which keeps getting better. The handling is not for the weak but the Evoque handles all rough terrains with no hassles. Sitting on the Premier Auto Showroom floor it can be a mean beast on the road. With worldwide sales of nearly 34 000 units in 2013 and thousands more to date, the Range Rover Evoque still tops the most wanted list of premium compact SUVs in the world and makes a further leap forward with the introduction of a host of new technologies for its facelift.These technologies aim to keep the svelte SUV at the front of the chasing pack by lowering fuel consumption and CO2 emissions as well as introducing new comfort and convenience features.The automatic transmission and five new driver assistance features are the technical highlights. First shown at the Geneva Motor Show in March three years ago, the ZF-9HP automatic transmission is among the world s first 9-speed units fitted to a passenger car.It has an ultra-fast response time, described by ZF as below the threshold of perception and an adaptive shift programme that quickly learns driving style.With a wide spread of ratios and improved efficiency, the new transmission delivers improved economy, reduced emissions, enhanced performance and greater comfort. It will also benefit towing ability.Coupled to the acclaimed terrain response condition-specific matrix, it gives the Range Rover Evoque the ability to master just about any driving environment.Adding to that is a raft of optional driver assistance features. These include, Park Exit (to automatically exit parallel parking bays), Perpendicular Park (to position the car centrally in parking bays), Closing Vehicle Sensing and Reverse Traffic Detection (to warn drivers of oncoming traffic) and Wade Sensing.In addition, a Torque Vectoring by Braking feature, available across both powertrains, further enhances agility and safety by redirecting torque between all four wheels to counteract understeer.In addition to the new technologies, there are detail changes to the Evoque s exterior, new colour options for the interior, four new alloy wheel styles and a new style of Land Rover badge on the grille, wheel centres and tailgate.It has new exterior mirrors, despite a reduced overall size, these do not adversely affect rearward visibility and provide better see-through between the A-pillar and the mirror housing.The model line-up now consists of three equipment grades: the new Pure, along with the existing Prestige and Dynamic models. The easiest way to tell them apart at a glance is badging and wheels: Pure has 18-inch wheels and Evoque badging in black, the Prestige goes up an inch to 19s and has badging in silver, and the Dynamic combines 20-inch wheels and red badging.Panoramic sunroof, privacy glass, rain-sensing wipers, Xenon headlamps, power tailgate and Navigation are just some of the features also fitted as standard to the Prestige, while the Dynamic adds grained leather for the upholstery, full electric adjustment on the front seats, and as a luxury flourish illuminated tread plates.All derivatives gain a sliding centre console armrest, with fore/aft travel in the order of 150mm. An extensive array of options allows every Range Rover Evoque owner to build a car to their tastes, whether talking wheel style or headlining colour.A choice of three contrast roof colours continues to be available, and while the sky is pretty much the limit when combining with the main body colour, customers are aided in their selection by recommended combinations and designer s choices.The Range Rover Evoque range is powered by Land Rover s economical and lightweight four-cylinder engines with a choice of either the 2.2 diesel 140kW SD4 engine or 2.0 petrol 177kW Si4 engine.Thanks to the revolutionary new transmission, fuel usage is improved by around 5 percent and carbon dioxide emissions reduced by up to four percent depending on model. So if you are looking for power, class and style all wrapped in one, don t let the Evoque size delude you, dynamite does in fact come in small packages.
