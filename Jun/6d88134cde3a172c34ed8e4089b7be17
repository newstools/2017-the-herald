COLOMBO. &#8211; Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga faced an investigation yesterday after he compared a government minister to a monkey following criticism that the country s cricketers were too fat. Sports minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said he ordered an inquiry after Malinga lambasted him for questioning the endurance of Sri Lankan players following their failure to reach the Champions Trophy semi-finals. He is now under investigation for making statements to the media in breach of his contract with Sri Lanka Cricket (board), Jayasekera said. In my criticism of the appalling fitness levels of our players, I did not name Malinga, but he has chosen to put the hat on and attack me publicly. Malinga told a television network the minister knew nothing about cricket. I don t care about criticism from those who are simply warming chairs, he said. What does a monkey know about a parrot s nesting hollow? This is like a monkey getting into a parrot s nest and talking about it. Jayasekera said some Sri Lankan players had pot bellies that stopped them moving and that often they could not hold catches. Pakistan skipper Sarfraz Ahmed was twice dropped in his side s Champions Trophy win over Sri Lanka. Both catches were off the bowling of Malinga, who ended up with just one wicket for 52 runs. &#8211; AFP.
