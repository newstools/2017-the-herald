Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter GLEN VIEW 1 High School will host a Zifa Level One soccer coaching course from June 12 to 18. The event, which is being organised by Zifa, will be graced by Moses Chunga and Bhekhimpilo Nyoni and is targeting teachers in the Glen View and High Glen district. Speaking ahead of the course, Chunga said they expect teachers from different schools to attend the week-long course. We are looking forward to empower the teachers as the knowledge they will gain through the course will help students back at their respective schools. The good thing is we are not only looking at teachers, but even outsiders. We saw the gap between school sports and academies and realised that it is good to empower teachers with coaching knowledge. Zifa coaching instructors will conduct the courses and those who would have excelled will be given Level One coaching courses. We are trying to complement Zifa s efforts and also see that the new curriculum is implemented, said Chunga.The coaches are expected to bring training kits, a whistle and a stopwatch for the course. We are looking at about 50 participants and we urge anyone who is willing to be a coach in future to come and join. The programme is expected to spread to other districts and help zonal areas coaches. We are grateful to Zifa for giving us this chance to empower our coaches and also we salute the Mufakose High 2 head in charge of soccer and the Glen View High 1 headmaster for the venue, he said.
