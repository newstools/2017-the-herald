Scotland keeper Matty Cross takes a catch behind to remove Zimbabwe bat Sean Williams for 70 off Berrington at a time when he looked like taking the game away from Scotland www.donald-macleod.comZIMBABWE will be out to avoid another humiliation when they take on Scotland in the second ODI in Edinburgh today, after slumping to defeat in a rain-hit match on Thursday. The Chevrons came into that match as favourites.And the Zimbabweans appear to have developed a sense of respect for their hosts. They do play good shots and we knew we were going to be up against it, especially in their home conditions Malcolm Waller, whose 92 almost took the Chevrons home, said. But we ve got to jump around. We ve got to be ready for the next game and make sure that we finish on top. Scotland have a spring in their step. This is what we ve been waiting to do for a little while. We ve taken a little bit longer than other teams have, but we ve now got a strong squad of players and we hope that we could still keep on challenging and maybe play some of the other Test-ranked teams, Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer said on the impact of beating ZimbabweThe far north of the UK is a place where chilly, damp weather is a common occurrence round the year.Regardless of what Zimbabwe may have read about Edinburgh beforehand, not much would have prepared them for the cold shower they experienced on Thursday in the form of a loss to Scotland in the maiden ODI between the two countries.Losing a pair of home series to Afghanistan is one thing, with the consensus being that Afghanistan s on-field quality has outstripped their administrative status as an Associate a view further cemented by Afghanistan drawing the ODI series on their first visit to the West Indies earlier this month.As much as Scotland have improved their on-field product in recent years under coach Grant Bradburn, the bare fact was that they had never beaten a Full Member in 23 attempts prior to Thursday.But, by the end of the day, Zimbabwe found themselves on the wrong side of history. Less than two days after that wake-up call, Zimbabwe have a chance to save face and level the series.Scotland are currently third in the WCL Championship, three points behind Netherlands and if Zimbabwe are swept 2-0 in Edinburgh, the prospect of three one-dayers next week in Amsterdam becomes even more daunting.Scotland, on the other hand, have a chance to create a double-dose of history.South Africa-born Con de Lange first came to Scotland in 2003 as an overseas pro for Ferguslie CC in Paisley.After marrying a local girl and putting down roots in his adopted homeland, he made his Scotland debut in 2015 and has since become one of their most reliable talents.Named vice-captain in January, he turned in his maiden ODI five-for in the win on Thursday and will look to restrict Zimbabwe once again.Chris Mpofu, who was Zimbabwe s leading wicket-taker in the five-match series against Afghanistan, was a surprising omission in the first ODI.Richard Ngarava struggled badly, both with the new ball and at the death, to finish with one for 96 the joint second-worst figures for a Zimbabwe bowler in ODIs. A direct swap for the two is most likely on the bowling front, while Chamu Chibhabha might also get a look in after another ODI failure for Ryan Burl.Unlike the on-and-off rain on Thursday that resulted in Zimbabwe s chase being reduced to 43 overs, today is forecast to be one of the clearest and hottest days of the late spring and early summer in Edinburgh, with a high of 24 degrees centigrade and no rain in the area.Expect another flat, bat-first pitch with a 300-plus target in mind.&nbsp;Zimbabwe (probable):1 Hamilton Masakadza, 2 Solomon Mire, 3 Chamu Chibhabha, 4 Craig Ervine, 5 Sean Williams, 6 Sikandar Raza, 7 Malcolm Waller, 8 PJ Moor (wk), 9 Graeme Cremer (capt), 10 Tendai Chatara, 11 Chris Mpofu &#8211; Sports Reporter/Cricinfo
