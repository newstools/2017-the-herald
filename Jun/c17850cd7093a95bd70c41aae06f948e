Andy MurrayPARIS. World number one Andy Murray said he expected a tough game after he came from a set down to beat unseeded Slovakian Martin Klizan in the French Open second round. The Briton won 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-2 7-6 (7-3) and goes on to face Argentina s Juan Martin del Potro. I expected it to be very tough, said Murray. He goes for huge shots and on his forehand he can hit winners anywhere on the court. Sometimes you think you have hit a good shot and then he comes up with unbelievable power from a defensive position. It was very tough. I tried to play a solid match. As it went on I hit deeper and started to dictate more points. It was Murray s 18th win of a season that has been interrupted by illness and injury. British number two Kyle Edmund also progressed after beating Renzo Olivo 7-5 6-3 6-1.The 22-year-old Yorkshireman will next play South Africa s Kevin Anderson, who beat Australian Nick Kyrgios 5-7 6-4 6-1 6-2. Del Potro, seeded 29th after his own injury struggles, went through when his opponent Nicolas Alamgro retired at one set all. BBC Sport.&nbsp;
