MANCHESTER. &#8211; Manchester City have given Nolito permission to speak to Sevilla as he moaned that his time in England was like living in a cave . During a bizarre interview in Spain, the winger claimed his daughter Lola s face had changed colour because of the North West weather. They are comments unlikely to go down well in Manchester after last summer s 13,8million signing from Celta Vigo failed to live up to early-season hype.City want 12m for a permanent deal but Sevilla would prefer a loan switch. Either way, his exit looks set to be confirmed in the coming weeks. By January, the 100,000-a-week star was effectively deemed surplus to requirements by Pep Guardiola and embarrassingly sidelined by Jesus Navas. My daughter s face has changed colour &#8211; it looks like she s been living in a cave, the 30-year-old told Spanish radio station El Transistor. I have learnt very, very little English &#8211; it s very hard. Just tomorrow , good morning , good afternoon and a little more. I don t think City are counting on me too much, given how I ve played since January. Vigo and Real Betis are interested in taking Nolito on loan, while he was spotted talking to Sevilla s sporting director Oscar Arias in an ice cream parlour on Tuesday.But Nolito, who was one of Guardiola s first signings as City boss, said he was merely shopping in Seville when he bumped into Arias by chance. I was just casually shopping for clothes for my wife in Seville, he added. I went to get a coffee and bumped into Sevilla s director of football casually. I later met the Sevilla president, and I m just glad no-one took a photo. I don t think City are counting on me too much, given how I ve played since January. I am under the contract, so the club will decide, but I want to leave. I haven t played in six months. I will do everything possible to make Spain s World Cup squad.
