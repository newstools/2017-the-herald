Business Reporter Online logistics company, Zimloads.com has come up with a digital platform which contains a database of companies operating in the transport sector with the aim of improving the ease of doing business in the logistics space. Zimloads.com chief executive Wilmore Makonese told The Herald Business that the idea was born out of the need to bring sanity in the industry while also making sure customers do not lose funds to unscrupulous middlemen. We are formalising processes, adding value, saving money, increasing transparency and many more benefits. This is going to be the lifeblood of the transport industry. We believe that this is going to bring transparency while also getting rid of situations where customers have been hoodwinked by middlemen, said Mr Makonese.He said 100 transporters gave the nod to the platform. In short, Zimloads.com will enable transport industry players to save money and time by bringing everything into one hub and reducing their work to just a few clicks on their phones, he said. We have the most comprehensive database for all types of transporters for instance crane lorries, refrigerated trucks, small vans, 30 tonne flat beds, tippers, fuel tankers, car carriers among others. Our network is expanding into South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our vision is long term and we aim to reach millions of customers across the world, said Mr Makonese.
