GMB silosWalter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau&#8212; A two-tier black market system has emerged outside most Grain Marketing Board (GMB) depots countrywide where grain rejected for moisture content in excess of the accepted 12,5 percent threshold ends up being sold.

I have been here since Monday because of the high number of trucks bringing grain but I have just been told that my maize has high moisture content, which has put all my plans in disarray, said Mr Story Takawira who was contemplating his next move after being turned away at GMB Lions Den depot. Although we are supposed to sell the grain produced under Command Agriculture here (GMB), we are left with no choice but to sell on the black market. He said he could not take back the maize back to his farm in Chinhoyi as there was no more storage.Another farmer from Kanyaga in Makonde district said his grain had 12,6 percent moisture content in the morning yesterday but was surprised to be told in the afternoon that it had 13 percent.Mr Isaac Musavengana who hired a truck for $140 said owing to the rejection of his maize, he was being expected to pay another $140 for a return trip or sell the maize at the black market. I have grain under Command Agriculture but because of the situation here at GMB, I am forced to sell at the black market, he said.Similar sentiments were shared by farmers at Banket and Mhangura depots.However, farmer organisations have called on farmers to desist from selling grain on the black market and wait for the grain to dry naturally using polythene to expedite drying.Zimbabwe Farmers Union president Retired Major Abdul Credit Nyathi, called on farmers to be patient before hurriedly taking their grain to GMB. For better storage GMB needs moisture content of 12,5 percent and below so that it can be stored properly in silos. Our farmers should use polythene sheets to speed up the drying process instead of selling their grain on the black market, said Rtd Maj Nyathi. Our farmers will get less on the black market to their detriment. Federation of Young Farmers Club of Zimbabwe board member Mr Tapiwanashe Chikondowa, condemned corruption saying investigations should be conducted. If indeed there are such practices, the law should take its course so that the culprits are brought to book. Farmers on the other hand should be patient, he said.Due to government intervention and promises of instant money, farmers are taking their grain to the GMB earlier than usual.Through natural means grain is sufficiently dry around August while some farmers are being forced to take out their crop early to make way for their winter crop.Hiring a dryer costs around $20 per tonne and most farmers would have no budget for it.GMB has called on farmers to take samples for testing before delivering large amounts of grain to depots.
