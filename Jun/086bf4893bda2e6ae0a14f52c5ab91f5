GLASGOW. England captain Harry Kane was proud of his side s reaction to Scotland s quickfire double in Saturday night s 2-2 draw at Hampden Park. Kane s goal deep into added time earned a point for England after a pair of Leigh Griffiths free-kicks had turned the game on its head in favour of Scotland.The Tottenham striker was captaining his country for the first time and felt it was testament to their quality that his team-mates did not let their heads drop after falling behind late in the World Cup soccer qualifier. It was fantastic, Kane said. I think going 2-1 down in the manner that we did, a lot of heads could have dropped or people could have been sulking or so forth. But everyone stood up to it. They dug deep and found a goal out of nothing really, so that s what it s about. It is about standing up and being counted and we did that today. Obviously I was wearing the armband today but I think we ve got a lot of leaders in the team. It was great for me personally to lead the team out, a very, very proud moment and to get that goal at the end made it even more special. I think being part of a leader is standing up when it matters and to get that goal at the end was important. Kane s last-gasp goal saved England from their first qualifying defeat since October 2009, but their lead in Group F is down to two points after Slovakia claimed victory in Slovenia. Sky Sports.
