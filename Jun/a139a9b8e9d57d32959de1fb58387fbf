Dr Sacrifice Chirisa Mental Health Matters A personality disorder (PD) is a type of mental disorder in which you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning and behaving. A person with a personality disorder has trouble perceiving and relating to situations and people.This causes significant problems and limitations in relationships, social activities, work and school.Individuals usually do not realise that you have a personality disorder because your way of thinking and behaving seems natural to them to the point of blaming others for the challenges they face.Beginning in the teenage years or early adulthood, there are many types of personality disorders. Some types may become less obvious throughout middle age. Types of PDs are grouped into three main clusters, based on similar characteristics and symptoms. We will discuss cluster A and B this week.Cluster A: Are characterised by odd, eccentric thinking or behaviour.Paranoid PDPervasive distrust and suspicious of others and their motivesUnjustified belief that others are trying to harm or deceive youUnjustified suspicion of the loyalty or trustworthiness of othersHesitancy to confide in others due to unreasonable fear that others will use the information against youPerception of innocent remarks or non-threatening situations as personal insults or attacksAngry or hostile reaction to perceived slights or insultsTendency to hold grudgesUnjustified, recurrent suspicion that spouse or sexual partner is unfaithfulSchizoid PDLack of interest in social or personal relationships, preferring to be alone.Limited range of emotional expressionInability to take pleasure in most activitiesInability to pick up normal social cuesAppearance of being cold or indifferent to othersLittle or no interest in having sex with another personSchizotypal PDPeculiar dress, beliefs, speech or behaviourOdd perceptual experiences, such as hearing a voice whisper your nameFlat emotions or inappropriate emotional responsesSocial anxiety and a lack of or discomfort with close relationshipsIndifferent, inappropriate or suspicious response to others Magical thinking influencing people and events with your thoughtsBelief that casual incidents or events have hidden messages meant only for youCluster B personality disorders: are characterised by dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behaviour.
