The event dubbed Salvation Concert was held over the weekend at Theatre in the Park. Prolific musicians such as Joseph Madziyire, Sabastian Magacha, Mcdonald Chidavaenzi, Kuda Mutsvene and Pastor Sam Nhubu of Heartfelt International Ministries choir were among others in attendance.Host of the night was Kudzai Dududa who flawlessly sailed through his paces. Clad in African print uniforms, Rupapa affectionately known as Sir Benjamin and his backing vocalists wowed the crowd as they dished out songs from the upcoming album Salvation such as Ndirori Vhangeri , Ndishandurei , Muzukuru Wangu , Praise Medley and Worship Medley .Sir Benjamin was later joined on stage by Sabastian Magacha as they performed NdiJesu Wakandinakira . The icing on the cake came when Sir Benjamin s brother, Fulton Rupapa surprised him on stage as he belted out Ndifadze Denga .Sir Benjamin could not hide his joy as he shed tears after his brother who is based in the United Kingdom chose to sneak into the country for the live DVD launch and recording. At first I thought it was a compact disc playing but then said to myself this is my brother s voice. I couldn t believe it when he was on stage as I was shocked. I want to thank everyone who supported this project since day one, he said.Sir Benjamin added that now is the time to spread salvation to the world. The live DVD is done and now is the time to market it well. I chose the title Salvation, because I want to tell the world about Jesus Christ s coming. We have heard different messages from other gospel singers but not many talked about salvation. My album has different genres so as to cater all age groups.
