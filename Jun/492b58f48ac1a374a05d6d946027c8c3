(0)1 A SECOND half brace from substitute Courage Denias and another goal from Guthrie Zhokinyi were enough to give Triangle a comfortable victory against Shabanie Mine in a midweek Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Gibbo yesterday.The home side had the luxury of missing a first-half penalty. Zhokinyi scored first in the 58th minute before Denias header doubled the advantage in the 63th minute.Denias completed his brace five minutes later to seal victory. Sweet victory for us, it s only our second win after six outings at home. I am happy that after missing the penalty we came back strong and scored the much-needed goals, coach Taurai Mangwiro said.Triangle were awarded a penalty 11 minutes into the match after a handball from Trevor Mavhunga and defender Ralph Kawondera took the responsibility, but his spot-kick was well saved by impressive goal-minder Samuel Mafukidze.The visitors missed two instrumental players Charles Makoto and Farai Mupasiri through injury. Dylan Chivandire scored for them from the spot. It was a different game from the referees today, every decision was going against us throughout the match, said Shabanie coach Takesure Chiragwi. The penalty they got was not a fair call and the referees gave them the confidence to come back into the game.
