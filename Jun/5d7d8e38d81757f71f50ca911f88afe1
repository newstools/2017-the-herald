LONDON. Alexis Sanchez is unlikely to ever ask for a day off work, but it is probably time one of his managers forced him to have a rest.After a domestic soccer season in which Sanchez played in every single one of Arsenal s English Premier League and Champions League matches, as well as five out six games on the way to FA Cup glory, he has helped Chile to the final of the Confederations Cup. Chile s participation in Russia has ensured Sanchez plays a fourth consecutive summer of international football. He is not the sort to take it easy at a tournament that, realistically, few will remember once it is done. Can you remember who won the 2013 Confederations Cup?He played at the World Cup in 2014 and the Copa America the following two years. Assuming Chile make it to Russia 2018 and he plays at the 2019 Copa America, Sanchez will go between 2013 and 2020 without a summer off. The run could be extended another year if he plays at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.As with this year s Confederations Cup, Sanchez and Chile made it to the final (winning both times) of the last two editions of the Copa America. He played a key role at both, scoring the winning penalty in the 2015 final and winning best player as Chile retained their title a year later.On Sunday, he ll play yet in another final, having also featured in every game on the way there, while other players sun themselves in exotic parts of the world or a field at Glastonbury.
