LONDON. &#8211; The coach of a Spanish youth soccer team has been sacked after a 25-0 win because the club s management decided the margin of victory went against the spirit of the game. After defeating fellow Valencia side Benicalap C on June 3, Serranos B s Under-11 manager was removed from his position. We believe in encouraging respect for your opponents. After the result, we decided that the manager should leave, Pablo Alcaide, who helps run the side, told El Pais.However, the Spanish newspaper also published comments from the manager s lawyer, who insisted his client had not pushed players to score as many as they could.The manager instead instructed his side to pressure only in their own half in the eight-a-side game, but Benicalap C continued to attack and left spaces in behind , the lawyer said.The game was Benicalap C s final match of the season. They finished bottom of the league with zero points and 247 goals conceded from their 30 matches. &#8211; BBC Sport.
