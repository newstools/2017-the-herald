(1)1ZPC Kariba . . . . . . . . 0 TRIANGLE laboured to a win over ZPC Kariba in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Gibbo yesterday.The match started on a slow pace with both teams failing to string meaningful passes as they struggled to create goalscoring chances.The home side, however, opened the scoring in the 23rd minute through Dzingai Chirambamuriwo after a well worked counter-attack.Pint-sized captain Nhamo Lameck was the architect of the goal as his pass was utilised by former Mufakose High School pupil Chirambamuriwo who pushed his effort from an acute angle past Tendai Hove.It was sweet victory for Triangle assistant coach Godfrey Tamirepi against his former side. Sweet victory indeed against my former side ZPC Kariba after a frustrating loss away from home against a Harare City. We just hope the victory will give us the much-needed confidence going into the Tsholotsho match as we search for our first consecutive victories in the season, said Tamirepi.TeamsTriangle: C.
