Paul Mundandi in ZVISHAVANE Shabanie Mine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 Black Rhinos . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 SHABANIE Mine must be cursing themselves as to how they failed to win this match given their dominance all afternoon at Maglas yesterday. Masvingo assistant referee Tainec Mwadira had to be escorted by the police with fans unhappy with a call he made in the 40th minute when he flagged Nelson Maziwisa for offside.Admire Dzumbunu made a solo run on the left and sent a cross into the box which saw Maziwisa outpacing his marker and placing a firm header past goalkeeper Herbert Rusawo.The referee pointed to the spot but Mwadira flagged for offside.Shabanie coach Takesure Chiragwi was once again left shaking his head in disbelief. I am doing my job. I am proud of my players but I feel the assistant referee decided the outcome of the game. It was a cross and the finishing comes from a striker who was behind a defender. He cost us the match and as a team we are failing to get full results because of some decisions from some match officials. I will, however, forgive him because he is human and to err is human. A human can make mistakes but I am worried about the situation he is putting us under after playing so well. I look forward to get maximum points in our next match, said Chiragwi.Black Rhinos coach Stix Mtizwa was content with a draw. It is very hard to play a team coming from a defeat. I am happy with the draw. The suspension of my key players affected our rhythm but I am happy with those who came in. Shabanie played well .We were under pressure, but I am happy that we managed to maintain our unbeaten run.
