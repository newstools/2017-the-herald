LONDON. There was a weary look and sound to Arsene Wenger throughout most of the past season that hinted at an Arsenal manager no longer capable of the dynamism needed to be the best. But after signing a new two-year deal with the Gunners, having won the backing of owner Stan Kroenke and the club hierarchy, the Frenchman is again sounding like a man with goals that match those of the club s most avid supporters. They are of course unlimited, our ambitions. We live in a very competitive world where you need the support of the owner as well. He s highly ambitious and supportive as well so, on that front, we are all united with exactly the same targets, he told the club s website in an interview released on Wednesday. The message to the fans is . . . Let s be together to support our players, to support the club and all give our absolute best to be at the level that we want to be. Reuters.
