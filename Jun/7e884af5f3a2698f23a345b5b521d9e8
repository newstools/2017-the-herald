What is the worst thing that could happen if an employee or manager lose their personal or company-provided mobile device? Unless they backed up their data, they would lose their contacts list, photos or videos and other vital information. They would also risk a breach in their company s data security if they have stored company information on their mobile device.Unsecured mobile devices are the weakest link in any company s data security strategy because, like other technologies that have become commonplace, mobile devices are easily taken for granted in terms of ensuring their security. From communication to mobile money transactions, the numerous functions of mobile device render these gadgets indispensable in the professional and private lives of Zimbabweans.Hence, any lack of vigilance in mobile device security is a terrible omission considering that more than 8 billion megabytes of data was utilised from mobile devices by Zimbabweans last year. A 2016 final quarter report by the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) found that mobile internet data usage rose by 19 percent indicating a growing reliance upon mobile devices to access the internet.While there are no statistics to establish the precise activities for which the mobile internet data was used, it is likely that checking work emails is a regular occurrence amongst employed mobile users. The question of how to secure mobile devices, beyond passwords and pin-codes, must be prioritised, especially by companies whose workforce relies heavily on mobile devices to stay connected.Since many employees open work emails from their mobile devices, possibly downloading and storing work-related data on their phones unsecured mobile devices can be the weakest link in securing company data. The obvious solution would be to encourage employees to never open work emails from their mobile devices but that would be impractical since email communication continues to see strong use in the business world.In 2017, the total number of business and consumer emails sent and received per day will reach 269 billion, according to the Radicati Group no doubt Zimbabweans will contribute several millions in email correspondence to this figure.So, what practical measures can Zimbabwean employers and their employees take to secure mobile devices and protect sensitive company data that may be inadvertently stored on them?The answer to securing mobile devices for businesses lies in an IT security solution that is being offered by the country s leading internet service provider, ZOL Zimbabwe which offers ESET for Business package called ESET Endpoint Protection Standard (EEPS).
