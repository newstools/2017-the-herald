Cristiano RonaldoMOSCOW. &#8211; Portugal are set to rest Cristiano Ronaldo for today s clash against New Zealand as the Euro 2016 winners look to confirm their passage into next week s Confederations Cup soccer semi-finals. Ronaldo brushed off allegations of tax evasion in Spain with man-of-the-match performances in the 2-2 draw with Mexico and 1-0 win over Russia, when he scored the winner. Ferdinand Santos is expected to rest some stars, including captain Ronaldo, against the Kiwis.AC Milan s new signing Andre Silva should lead Portugal s attack in the David verses Goliath clash in St Petersburg. Things remain tight in Group A before today s final round. Mexico, top of Group A equal with Portugal on four points by virtue of having scored one more goal, face Russia, who are just a point behind in third.Only fourth-placed NZ have no chance after losing their two games so far. The Kiwis will breath a slight sigh of relief if Ronaldo is rested with the Real Madrid star having netted 15 times in his last nine games for club and country. Even if you take Ronaldo out of the team, you still have world-class players like (Ricardo) Quaresma and Nani, we have a game plan and we won t be over-awed, said Kiwi coach Anthony Hudson. The Portuguese probably don t want to be playing New Zealand right now. Like he did before the Mexico game, Hudson called on the Kiwis to be brave against the European champions. - AFP.
