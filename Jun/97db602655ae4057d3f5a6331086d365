I have worked with him on several occasions, but we have never gone been at the Nyanga concert together. I have heard about the concert and many people say it is a great time to have fun at the resort, said Kawara. I promise the best outing with my fans. There is no better time to beat winter than to go and dance indoors with fans from all walks of life. Organisers of the concert said they have put everything in place ahead of the event. We have done everything and the response is overwhelming. Golfers have registered in huge numbers and we will definitely have a big event. After golf we will go to the hotel for a prize-giving ceremony and the concert will follow thereafter, said Montclair general manager Brian Nyakutombwa. The event has brought fun to this place over the past years. It is always good to have the competition at the golf course then cap the night with music and dance. It will be fun throughout. Last time Hugh came as a surprise act and we are not ruling out another surprise this year. We welcome Alexio to this year s event and we know he will deliver the best.
