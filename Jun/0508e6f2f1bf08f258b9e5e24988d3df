Romeo GasaTawanda Marwizi recently in Karoi Sungura musician Romeo Gasa left hundreds of music lovers cheated when he came late for a show at Zvipani Township in Karoi on Friday. By 10pm the musician was nowhere near the venue and the PA system was not set. Entertainment-starved fans who had come as far as Magunje to see their celebrity felt cheated by the musician. When Gasa arrived around 11pm, he received a hero s welcome from fans who were waiting to see him.His sound engineers made the situation worse by failing to make proper connections and some fans left the venue in protest. About 100 fans were patient enough to wait for the musician to go on stage around midnight.The musician s album Mupedza Nyaya seems to be popular as fans were singing along most of the songs. Other songs that were popular include Simbi Hombe , Dadi and Kutanda Botso .Gasa said he was happy that people appreciate his talent out there. It was just unfortunate that I came late but the response here is overwhelming. This has been the case whenever we perform in places like this one, he said.He said next time he will make it up to the fans in Zvipani. He performed until early hours of Saturday. One Pablo Sidachi said it was unfortunate that some of the musicians take their fans for granted. This is a small community and when a musician is coming we expect him/her to come on time so that we go back home on time, he said. We only see these musicians only once. It s high time musicians come here and perform in a way that does not leave us disappointed, one Samson Mutora said.
