MELBOURNE. &#8211; A bitter pay dispute between Australia s cricketers and the national board appears set to remain unresolved by today s deadline, leaving more than 200 players unemployed and upcoming series against Bangladesh and England in jeopardy. Eleventh hour talks have failed to produce a breakthrough this week and relations have soured to the point that the players union is refusing to deal with Cricket Australia s (CA) lead negotiator.The Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) has demanded CA s long-serving chief executive James Sutherland step up to the dealing table and help end a standoff that could ultimately trigger a damaging round of player boycotts.The existing pay deal, known as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), will expire at midnight today, two days before players selected for an Australia A tour of South Africa are to report for a training camp in Brisbane.CA has remained silent on Sutherland s intentions but high performance boss Pat Howard has made the board s position clear.Howard warned players in an email on Wednesday not to sign with other sponsors or play in disapproved cricket in case it put them at risk of a potential, future CA contract. &#8211; Reuters.
