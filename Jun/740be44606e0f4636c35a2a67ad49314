Baku. &#8211; Fresh from a glorious season-saving triumph at one of his favourite venues, Lewis Hamilton sets out to tame his unpredictable and sometimes wayward diva of a Mercedes again as the Formula One circus endures sizzling heat at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The three-time world champion s victory at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier this month &#8211; his sixth at the Montreal track &#8211; hauled him back within 12 points of championship leader Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari and sharpened his appetite for a maiden success on the streets of Baku, the only venue on the current calendar where he has never won. I was very quick there last year, but I just didn t deliver, said Hamilton. So, this time, the plan is to make sure I deliver. After an inconsistent opening to the season in which he and Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas have struggled badly at times, Hamilton bounced back to his best in Montreal to claim his third win in seven races as Mercedes produced a crushing one-two success.He arrives in Baku with team boss Toto Wolff s praise endorsing his behaviour and performances. Lewis is in the best place I ve seen him in any of the five years since I joined the team, said Wolff. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
