LONDON. Pep Guardiola wants his Manchester City full-backs to play in the way Dani Alves did for him when they were together at Barcelona and the easiest way to do that is to buy the Brazilian soccer star himself. Sources have told ESPN that City are interested in signing the Juventus right-back, who could be available for as little as 5 million.City are in the hunt for new full-backs after Guardiola allowed Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna and Gael Clichy to leave at the end of their contracts in June along with winger Jesus Navas, who ended the season at right-back.The coach wants more energy from his full-backs to implement his philosophy at City, which requires them to supplement attacks as well as defend. His options last season just weren t able to offer what he wanted and he had to alter his style to fit. We don t have full-backs to go up and down, up and down, because all of them are 33, 34 years old, so I adapt with the quality of players, Guardiola said after the 0-0 draw with Manchester United in April.
