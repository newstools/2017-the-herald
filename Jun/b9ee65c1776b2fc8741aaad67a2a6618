MADRID. Florentino Perez insists Real Madrid are not contemplating Cristiano Ronaldo s departure this summer. Ronaldo was last week accused of evading 14.7 million euros through offshore companies and will appear before a judge on July 31. The 32-year-old Portuguese star is facing four charges of fraud through offshore companies between 2011 and 2014.The hearing will take place at 09:00 GMT on July 31 in a court at Pozuelo de Alarc n, in the suburbs of Madrid, according to Spanish press reports.Prosecutors accuse the Portugal international of evading tax via a shell company based in the British Virgin Islands and another in Ireland, known for its low corporate tax rate.In addition, they say he only declared 11.5 million euros of Spanish-related income from 2011 to 2014, while what he really earned during that time was close to 43 million euros.And finally, they accuse him of voluntarily refusing to include 28.4 million euros in income linked to the sale of his image rights for the 2015 to 2020 period to a Spanish company.The four-time world player of the year, who said last week his conscience is clear , is threatening to leave Real Madrid over the affair. Perez will also seek showdown talks with Ronaldo to clarify his future, but only after Portugal s participation in the Confederations Cup comes to an end.The veteran forward is understood to want to leave Spain and is interested in returning to Manchester United, having become angry about the way he has been treated by Spanish tax authorities.
