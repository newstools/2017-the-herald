AUCKLAND. &#8211; The All Blacks believe they ve cracked the rugby code to beating the British and Irish Lions rushed defence, with coach Steve Hansen saying yesterday they have plans to outsmart their lightning line speed. Hansen also dismissed claims by his Lions counterpart Warren Gatland that he was worried ahead of the long-awaited first Test between the world champions and the Lions in Auckland tomorrow.Although the tourists have lost two midweek games, their shadow Test line-up managed to put away Super Rugby leaders Canterbury Crusaders and a strong Maori All Blacks side with a defensive intensity that crushed the life out of the opposition. You would assume that because they have had a lot of success with their line speed and their ability to dominate up front that that s what they ll try and do with us, Hansen said, after naming his Test team. Have we got a plan for it? Well obviously we hope we do, he added, without revealing how the All Blacks will combat the threat. We ll see how good the plan is when we get out there on Saturday night but it would be very foolish to believe they re not going to bring some line speed. &#8211; AFP.
