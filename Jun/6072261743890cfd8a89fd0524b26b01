Paul Mundandi recently in ZVISHAVANE FC PLATINUM attacking midfielder, Talent Chawapihwa, feels the Zvishavane Derby is one of the best in the country. He scored on Sunday in the 1-1 draw against rivals Shabanie Mine. It was my second time to play in the derby against Shabanie after clashing against them in the Msipa Charity Shield, he said. On Sunday, I really felt the atmosphere of a derby, the stadium was full and the fans were just marvellous and it was my first time to experience such a derby. I once heard Tatenda (Dzumbunu) telling me about it, but I did not believe him. I feel it the best in Zimbabwe even after having watched Dynamos playing CAPS. Fans in Zvishavane want it more and they will not stop supporting their teams until the final whistle. It was like a final and not a league game. Every player was giving his best. I remember William (Mapfumo) telling me on the field that his team was going to collect maximum points. I felt happy when I scored. The ball was laid to me and I connected with my right foot. And the greatest moment was when I dribbled past him (Mapfumo), but somehow I shot weakly at goal and their keeper saved it. I feel the goal I scored was a perfect birthday present to me as I will be turning 25 this Saturday. I also salute the referee for doing well in taking charge of the game. Chawapihwa was man-of-the-match for FC Platinum with William Mapfumo outstanding for Shabanie Mine. The Zvishavane derby grossed $13 753 after a total of 4 427 fans paid to watch the match.PSL chief executive Kenny Ndebele was also in attendance and asked the referees to delay the start of the game as a lot of fans were still outside the stadium at 3pm.
