Timothy NgwenyaArts Correspondent UK-based gospel musician Timothy Ngwenya last week assisted underprivileged children in Chinhoyi. The musician who grew up in the town, said he will start with assisting children from Chinhoyi before taking the initiative across the country. He helped five primary school children with school fees and says he wishes to have a number of vulnerable children assisted. I wish to have a number of these children assisted and so far we have started with only five. I want to thank God who gave me this light for the initiative, he said.Ngwenya is optimistic that the programme will grow and cater for several children. If resources permit we always want to have these programmes in different parts of the country. We will keep on praying to God so we keep it growing, he said.Timothy who is a young brother to another gospel musician Chaka Ngwenya said he was working on a new album that will be launched in September. There are a lot of things that are happening in our life and we need to pray. As gospel musicians we need to walk the talk, said Ngwenya. Usually, the gospel musician mixes his songs in all languages including Shona and English. I am hopeful that this album will lift up many souls because there are a number of worship songs, he said. Born in Hurungwe, the musician grew up in Chinhoyi and has recorded with Gramma records previously.He has shared stage with several gospel musicians that include Charles Charamba, Mahendere, Manyeruke and has collaborated with Rumbie Zvirikuzhe and Tyra Chikocho among others. I would not forget my brother Chaka Ngwenya who is in New York, he brought all this to my face and he told me I can do it. We did three albums together and he is my centre of inspiration, he said.Ngwenya said he has been moving from place to place due to work commitments. He is among musicians who started Ebenezer Gospel Promotions that has been taking several musicians to the UK.
