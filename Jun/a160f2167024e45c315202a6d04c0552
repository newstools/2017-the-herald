Amanda Chikari Midlands Reporter Government is set to build a temporary footbridge across Mwenezi River in Mberengwa as it mobilises funds to rehabilitate Jeka Bridge that was destroyed by floods early this year. The destruction of Jeka Bridge, which is located along the Danga-Dolo Road and crossing Mwenezi River in the Midlands province, has forced motorists to use a longer route passing through Gwanda in Matabeleland South.The construction of the foot bridge means motorists will continue to travel through the longer route.Mberengwa district administrator, Mr White Nkoma, said Jeka Bridge was a vital link between Mberengwa District and Gwanda. He said engineers were yet to come up with the exact amount of money required for the construction of the temporary footbridge, as well as the main bridge.Mr Nkoma said Government decided to construct a footbridge in the area as a temporary measure for villagers. Since the bridge was destroyed by floods early this year, Government has been trying to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the bridge and roads, but the bridge requires a lot of money as it needs to be re-constructed, Mr Nkoma said. It s unavailability has had a negative impact on business and trade, education and health as it leads to the Jeka referral centre where villagers and sick pupils at Chegato High School seek medical treatment. Mr Nkoma said the Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Engineer Michael Madanha, recently assured them that engineers were going to construct a temporary footbridge, while funds were being raised to construct the main bridge.He said the rehabilitation of roads in Mberengwa was underway. Rehabilitation of our roads had been stopped due to the fact that one of our main road graders had not been functioning, but now it has been repaired, the work is progressing well, Mr Nkoma said.
