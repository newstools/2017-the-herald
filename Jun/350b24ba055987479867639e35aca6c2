I am really shocked right now I wasn t expecting to do my best because I am just coming from an injury. So I wasn t really ready. But I had not received so much competition as of yet, so today I got the competition I needed. By seeing the people I was jumping with I was already scared. But I think that got me where I am right now, I didn t give up. I just feel happy right now that s all I can say, said Mapaya.The 18-year-old is set to represent the country at the forthcoming African Junior Championships in Algeria.Botswana scooped gold medals in most of the events to claim the top position with a total of 20 medals consisting of 12 gold, four silver and an equal number of bronze.South Africa followed with nine gold medals, 10 silver and five bronze and Mozambique were third after they scooped two gold, two silver and three bronze.On fourth place was Namibia while Seychelles and Lesotho were tied on position five with two gold medals each.Zambia and Swaziland finished eighth and ninth respectively while Malawi and Mauritius were tied on position 10 with three medals each.Zimbabwe had hoped to have some senior athletes qualifying for the IAAF World Championships in London in August, but this was not the case.Ngoni Makusha got two bronze medals for 100m and 200m and a silver medal in the 4x100m relay.The regional event was officially closed by the Minister of Sport and Recreation, Makhosini Hlongwane.
