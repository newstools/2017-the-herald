NEW YORK. World No 2 Rory McIlroy has recovered from a rib injury that has kept him out of action since the middle of May and has declared himself fit to compete at this month s US Open, the 28-year-old has said. The four-times major winner has been regaining fitness at the Quinta do Lago resort in Portugal and will return to action at the year s second major in Erin Hills, Wisconsin when the tournament begins on June 15. I am ready for Erin Hills and looking forward to playing there for the first time, McIlroy told The Guardian newspaper. The last few weeks have obviously been frustrating . . . but it was important I got back to a level of fitness where I felt like I could give myself the best possible chance at the US Open. As I have said many times before, majors will ultimately determine my golf career but I have had the rest of this busy season to consider as well. Reuters.
