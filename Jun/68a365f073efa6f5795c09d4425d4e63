Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter BUSHMAN Rock Polo Club will host the rebranded annual Ambassadors Cup with four teams expected to take part on June 30 and July 1. The prestigious tournament, which had Premier Auto Services as the title sponsor last year, has since roped in Fine and Country Zimbabwe as the new title sponsor. Now running as the Fine and Country Ambassadors Cup Polo Tournament, the competition will see four teams Fine and Country Eland, Safeguard Sables, Barclays Buffalos and Fine and Country Kudus fighting for honours.Fine and County Eland team players are the defending champions after they won the event last year under the name Eco-cash. Fine and Country chief executive Karen Nyenga said they were looking forward to continue sponsoring the sport and see it grow. Our aim is to support the sport which is seen by many as an elite sport and spread it to the people. Our sponsorship is at $10 000 and we hope it is going to help a lot for this tournament to be successful. I think this is a noble idea as all the proceeds from the tournament will go towards a yet to be identified charitable organisation, Nyenga said.The event is expected to bring on board current and past national team members, high-goal players and two visiting international Argentinian players. Jonathan Passaportis, a representative of Bushman Rock Polo Club, said they were happy with the support of the British Business Association. With the support of the British Business Association in Zimbabwe, the 2017 event promises to be bigger and more vibrant and also the involvement of the titles sponsor; the dynamic international real estate company Fine and Country, has added a fresh and exciting direction to the event. The British Ambassador, Catriona Laing, will be guest of honour at this prestigious event.
