Five countries from Africa, including Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Nigeria and Lesotho, had athletes who took part in the tournament that saw Zimbabwe claim three medals.This was the fourth edition of the tournament which has been held at the same venue every year. After the event Sensei Thulani Sibisi, from Katlehong Dojo, said the purpose of the tournament is to help those karatekas who are struggling financially. We want them to get a taste of high-level tournaments. We understand that they like to compete with the best karatekas from outside the country, but cannot attend due to financial issues. So we have decided to bring international full-contact style stars to their own township. Competing with international karatekas helps local karatekas to improve their fighting skills because they learn from the best, said Sibisi.
