Mr Nzabanita Business Reporter The Zimbabwe Multi Donor Trust Fund s $58 million phase two project being administered by the African Development Bank will be complete by next year, Zimfund manager Emmanuel Nzabanita confirmed. The phase two which is a successor project to phase one is targeting power, water and sanitation sectors. Almost $35 million has been set aside for water while about $23 million has been allocated for electricity and power under the phase two. We started the implementation of the Zimfund phase two project with about $58 million being allocated for water and electricity projects.Several towns have started benefitting from this project although some projects are yet complete. Zimfund phase two project full completion is earmarked for next year but some projects under this arrangement have since been completed. In July we expect to complete the Ruwa and Chitungwiza water and sanitation projects, said Mr Nzabanita. We hope water projects will be completed by January next year expect for Harare. We are happy with the significant progress made on the Zimfund projects so far, he said.Mr Nzabanita said the Hwange Ash Plant rehabilitation project which is now complete also falls part of the Zimfund phase two project.He said the $10,5 million refurbishment of the Hwange Ash Plant has a desirable impact to the residents of Hwange as it is expected to improve provision of adequate and reliable power supply in an environmentally sound manner.The investment made towards rehabilitation falls under fund which entails rehabilitation of key power sector assets in the generation, transmission and distribution systems.Under the Zimfund facility, the AFDB was requested by donors to establish and administer the facility. Under the phase one, the Zimfund managed to provide for Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project phase one in Mutare, Masvingo, Kwekwe, Chegutu, Harare, and Chitungwiza on the water side.The second phase of the Zimfund furthers the benefits and impacts of the first phase. It comprises aspects that were not included in the first phase of the project.While phase one focused more on restoring water and wastewater treatment capacity, phase two complements phase one by giving greater emphasis on improving both the water and sewerage network performance, strengthening commercial aspects and enhancing service delivery efficiency.Phase two is being implemented in Harare, Chitungwiza, Ruwa and Redcliff, serving an estimated population of 1,9 million people.In addition to rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure, the projects aims to build capacity of service providers in operation and maintenance, enhancing sustainability. The interventions will be complemented with hygiene promotion, targeting the most vulnerable segment of the population.On the energy side the facility provides funding for Emergency Power Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project for the rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution systems of the power network in Zimbabwe.According to the AFDB, the size of the Fund is determined by the willingness of development partners to contribute to it over time.To date, donor commitments to the ZimFund, in various currencies, add up to an equivalent of $144,5 million (excluding the funds allocated for phase two), out of which an actual amount of about $140,80 million has been released to the Fund s account as at end November 2015.Mr Nzabanita not Nzabantita
