LONDON. &#8211; Legendary cricket commentator Henry Blofeld is retiring from the BBC s Test Match Special team after nearly half a century &#8211; sparking an outpouring of emotional tributes. Known affectionately as Blowers , Blofeld (77) has charmed followers of the programme with his old-world approach to the job, with observations on London buses and pigeons as important as the action on the field.Blofeld s final stint will be the Lord s Test between England and West Indies starting on September 7. All good things come to an end, said Blofeld. After nearly 50 years in the Test Match Special commentary box, I have decided the time has come for the last of the old farts to hang up his microphone. In all honesty, at the age of almost 78, although I am still rather keener than mustard, I find it harder work than I once did. And I wouldn t want to let TMS down. Former England captain and fellow commentator Michael Vaughan tweeted: Many players have bought joy to thousands but I can t think of anyone who has bought more joy to the airwaves than @blowersh #MyDearOldThing. A tweet from the England cricket team s official account read: Thanks for the memories @blowersh and all the best in your retirement. Jonathan Agnew, who has shared a commentary box with Blofeld for many years, told BBC Radio 5 Live: I ll miss Henry, his enthusiasm, his company, his chaos. - AFP.
