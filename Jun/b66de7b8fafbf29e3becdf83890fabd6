Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter LUC RICHARD Mbah a Moute, the Cameroonian National Basketball Association star, jetted into the country for a high-profile three-day training camp.The Los Angeles Clippers forward arrived at Harare International Airport on the same flight with CAPS United. The forward is set to host the inaugural Luc Mbah a Moute Top 50 Basketball Camp for the best young male basketball players at Eaglesvale Senior School starting today. The tour has been facilitated by iBelieve Sports Academy and Fundamentally Astute Athletics. We hope we will be able to select one or two players. I think there is talent and some young kids just need to be given a chance like I was given to get a scholarship on basketball, said Moute.
