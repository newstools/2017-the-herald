Cyprian MandengeTakudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter SABLES coach Cyprian Super Mandenge believes they have done everything they can to overcome Senegal in a crucial Rugby Africa Gold Cup opening match in Dakar this afternoon. The coach is hopeful that they will get a victory against the West Africans. In Africa, not talking about South Africa, we are third at the moment and in the world we are on position 32 which is good for a nation. We respect Senegal as a team on number five, they are a good side and we will give them a good run. We are here to play rugby and we hope to do well. I think we need to win this one and that will boost our confidence. Winning should be a habit and we are not going to wait for next year to start winning when we need to qualify for the World Cup, said Mandenge.
