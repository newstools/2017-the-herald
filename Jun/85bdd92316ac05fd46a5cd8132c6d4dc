SOUTHAMPTON. &#8211; Captain AB de Villiers promised South Africa would fight our way back after England thrashed them by nine wickets in the first Twenty20 cricket international at Southampton on Wednesday. After the chastening defeat, which came after their first-round exit at the Champions Trophy, de Villiers said: It s not done and dusted. We go to Taunton (today) and like all South Africans we always fight our way back so I m expecting a really good performance in the next one. South Africa found runs hard to come by against an England side where spinners Liam Dawson and Twenty20 debutant Mason Crane both bowled tightly on their Hampshire home ground.Young leg-spinner Crane had a particularly encouraging debut with four overs for 24 runs and bowled one bad ball, his final delivery, a full toss hit for four by de Villiers. We know he has the potential and skill level, he has proved that at county level, said England captain Eoin Morgan of the 20-year-old Crane. It is about reigniting that form at international level. His skills are good, we know that, it is delivering them against (players like) de Villiers, who is one of the best of our generation &#8211; delivering against him is a task especially when he is coming after you. - AFP.&nbsp;
