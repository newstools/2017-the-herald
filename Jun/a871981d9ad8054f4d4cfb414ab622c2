Tawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent Organisers of the Lake July festival at Hunyani Hills Hotel on the shores of Lake Chivero have introduced shuttle services to ease congestion at the venue. The show is set for the last three days of July. Fans found it difficult to leave the venue last year following a massive response to the show with congestion lasting for more than two hours.F te organiser Tawanda Madzara said they have partnered with City Park and Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority to lower their rates for the merrymakers.He said City Park will lower their parking rates while ZimParks has availed the Caravan Park close to the venue of the event for those that would want to drive all the way to the lake.Merrymakers have a choice to leave their vehicles in town and use the shuttle services to the venue. Parking will be available at Julius Nyerere Parkade (Corner Julius Nyerere and Nelson Mandela), Parklane parking (located adjacent to Crown Plaza), Fourth Street Parking (corner fourth street and George Silinduka). Parking rates will be $3 for the whole day and $2 during the night. This would enable people to leave their vehicles at safe points and then use the shuttle service, he said.The shuttle buses will ferry revellers on an hourly basis from different designated pick up points in Harare. The shuttle services will ferry people to and from the lake. Those parking within the Harare CBD will then be ferried to the venue from shuttle services that will be scattered around the CBD, he said.Bon Fire Party, Beach Party and Beach Picnic are the major activities set for the big day.Leading radio station Star FM will be the official radio partner for the event.
