EGYPTIAN giants, Zamalek, are targeting maximum points and a step towards the knock-out round, when they host USM Alger on Match Day 3 today in Alexandria. Zamalek top Group B with four points, one more than their Algerian opponents after two games. The White Knights scored two unanswered goals against Zimbabwean champions, CAPS United, before holding Libya s Ahly Tripoli to a barren draw last week.USM Alger defeated Ahly Tripoli 3-0 before succumbing to a 2-1 defeat at CAPS. We are thinking of a game at a time , Zamalek coach Augusto Inacio said as his side launched preparations for the weekend clash. Now we close the domestic front page and thinking of our next CAF game . The Portuguese tactician who joined Zamalek last month has made it clear that his side s target is to go as far as lifting the title.Last season, Zamalek reached the final, before losing to eventual champions Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, extending their continental trophy drought which dates back to 2002, when they won their fifth CAF Champions League title. We think of only winning against USM Alger. They are a good side, but we will play to win. I believe my team can do it and win this group, with respect to all our opponents, added the 62-year-old, whose previous clubs include Portuguese giants, Sporting Lisbon.Zamalek are currently third in Egyptian Premier League rankings, having surrendered the title race to arch rivals Al Ahly who won the title for the 39th time in their history.The Egyptians will have to do without two key players in midfield; Tarek Hamed is suspended while Mahmoud Dunga Abdul Aty is injured.The White Knights will be banking on the Nigerian duo of Maaruf Youssef and Stanley Ohawuchi, besides the talents of their skipper Mahmoud Shikabala Abdul Razek.
