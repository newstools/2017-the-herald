Chipo Sabeta in TUNIS, Tunisia CAPS United doctor Nick Munyonga says Tafadzwa Rusike will be on the sidelines for two more weeks. Rusike was injured in their 2-4 loss against Al Ahli Tripoli and failed to travel for the return leg set for tomorrow evening here. Munyonga confirmed that Rusike was recovering from two injuries, an ankle and a contusion on the iliac crest (upper pelvic).The former Warriors doctor, who was roped in by the 2016 Zimbabwe champions, said he was working hard to put the situation under control. I am not worried by the ankle because he is getting there. In fact its the upper pelvic part that needs attention. He is still out for the next two weeks, before we start talking about light training, he said. Munyonga was happy with the progress made by some players.Valentine Musarurwa, Hardlife Zvirekwi, Dennis Dauda and Edmore Sibanda will be available for selection. I watched them in three full training sessions at home and am not worried about them. It s been a long journey and they might require a bit of attention since they are coming from injury. There is no need for aggressive painkillers or tablets for now.
