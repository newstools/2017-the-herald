LONDON. &#8211; Tottenham have told Manchester United they will need to DOUBLE the current world transfer record if they want to sign striker Harry Kane this summer. Reports emerged over the weekend that Jose Mourinho will shelve a potential approach for Real Madrid s wantaway star Cristiano Ronaldo and move for Kane in a 100 million deal instead. But those reports stirred only laughter from Spurs, with the north Londoners adamant that their prolific front-man will not be going anywhere.Chairman Daniel Levy has also made it clear that if United are serious about trying to lure Kane to Old Trafford, they will need to start the bidding at 200million.The current record transfer fee stands at 89 million &#8211; the amount United paid Juventus for Paul Pogba last summer &#8211; and the Red Devils would need to at least double that figure to land Kane. While such an offer seems unlikely, Jose Mourinho is a huge fan of the 23-year-old striker and sees him as a better long-term striking option than the likes of Robert Lewandowski. The England international &#8211; who skippered the Three Lions this summer &#8211; has scored at least 20 goals in each of the last three Premier League campaigns, and bagged 29 goals in 30 matches last season. &#8211; The Independent.
