Tobacco seedlings in bedsBuhle Nkomo I am impressed with drip irrigation technology because it means growing more for less. It is economic, it saves water and fertiliser, involving less labour while attracting good yields, says Shepard Goremusandu (49), a small scale tobacco farmer from Karoi in Mashonaland West Province. Goremusandu is one of the tobacco farmers who obtained drip irrigation from TIMB in 2015. The farmer said drip irrigation is the most efficient technology due to its controlled delivery of water directly to plants promoting uniformity amongst the crops while enhancing good yields as each crop gets the equal amount of water.As a result the grower said the facility made a notable difference in his production history. Prior to drip irrigation, my crops were rain fed. I was not happy with my produce as my harvest would range from 2 500 to 3 000kgs per hectare. Having a borehole as my source of water, I then installed the drip irrigation facility. I obtained 4 000kg from a hectare and quality yields with prices ranging from $5,20 highest price while lowest being $2,10.Goremusandu said that the scheme has not only encouraged good tobacco yields but also has increased his productivity as he is now using the same technology as a water supplement for horticulture purposes. Since drip irrigation is providing a reliable water supply throughout the year, I have planted a hectare of potatoes, cucumbers and tomatoes. I already secured the market and supply local canteens, boarding schools and local people he said.He added: This has given me giant steps as a farmer since my productivity has been increased. I want to increase my drip to a 5 hectare facility with tank reservoirs from my returns as part of my future plans. Goremusandu explained that one of the advantages of drip irrigation is that it encourages farmers to start early ploughing which is considered as part of good agronomic practices for increased yields. The seedbeds are underway. This suggests the facility has allowed me to start the season very early. This is good for quality yields because early ploughing is a way of trapping and conserving the moisture, he explained.The grower said that apart from tobacco production he also does poultry production for more income and other crops as a way of crop rotation.The 250 Robust Drip Irrigation kit I am also keeping broilers, harvesting at least 200 birds a week and my main market is a local butchery. Apart from tobacco farming I also grow maize, soya beans and sugar beans for more income and facilitating crop rotation he added.The grower explained that apart from having water source, farmers should also consider careful planning and investing in their curing facilities as these are critical for improved yields as quality determines the price. Planning, scheduling, upgrading my curing and irrigation facilities has improved my farming. Tobacco farming is the reason I drilled a borehole and installed drip irrigation. I have purchased my inputs for the next season, hired permanent workers and invested in cattle, he said.Drip irrigation is still on offer at TIMB and the following are required: The grower should have a production history which is attained from the TIMB system.He or she must be near the water source not more than 500 meters from the source. An application letter can be collected from the nearest TIMB regional office in which upon submission of it, it should be attached with certified copies of the national ID, photocopy of the offer letter and recommendation from the Agritex officer or the contractor.For additional Information contact TIMB on telephone numbers 08677004624 /6 or 0772145166 /9 or 0279-22082 /21982 or 025-3439 or 067-24268 /29246 or 0277-2700 or 064-7280 or 0271-6772 or Toll Free Numbers 08006003 / 0731999999 / 0712832804 or WhatsApp 0731999999 or E-mail: [email&#160;protected]
