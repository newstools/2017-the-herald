CARDIFF. &#8211; Pakistan cricket captain Sarfraz Ahmed insisted he always believed his side could turn their fortunes around after they reached the Champions Trophy final with a dominant eight-wicket win over England in Cardiff. Pace bowler Hasan Ali took three wickets as Pakistan dismissed England, the only unbeaten team left in the tournament, for a mere 211. In marked contrast to their nail-biting chase in a three-wicket, virtual quarter-final, win over Sri Lanka in Cardiff on Monday, Pakistan then cruised to a total of 215 for two with a mammoth 77 balls to spare.Azhar Ali (76) and Fakhar Zaman (57) dismissed England s attack to all parts of Sophia Gardens in an opening stand of 118. What made Wednesday s win all the more impressive was that it came just 10 days after Pakistan launched their Champions Trophy campaign with a woeful 124-run hammering by arch-rivals India.But just three days later Pakistan, the lowest-ranked side in a tournament featuring the world s top eight one-day international teams bounced back to defeat number one South Africa.Now Pakistan could have a chance for revenge against India in Sunday s final at the Oval if the title-holders beat Bangladesh in yesterda s second semi-final at Edgbaston. It is a cause of great pride and happiness for myself and for the entire Pakistan nation, said Sarfraz after the semi-final triumph. It was a team no one gave a chance, neither here nor back home, added the 30-year-old wicket-keeper, whose 61 not out was key to the victory over Sri Lanka. No one thought we d reach the final. Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur said before the semi-final that if his side played their best game they could put pressure on England. &#8211; AFP.
