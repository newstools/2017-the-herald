NEW YORK. Stocks eked out record highs on Friday but gains were limited as data showed job growth slowed in May, suggesting that a bounce in the labour market was losing steam. Non-farm payrolls increased by 138 000 last month, below the 185 000 expected by economists. Data for both March and April was revised to show 66 000 fewer jobs were created than previously reported.Average hourly earnings rose 0,2 percent in May, following a similar gain in April, but unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low of 4,3 percent in the previous month.While last month s job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month, the modest increase could raise concerns about the economy s health after GDP growth slowed in the first quarter.The economy needs to create 75 000 to 100 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Job gains are slowing as the labour market nears full employment. Odds of a rate hike at the Fed s June 13-14 meeting stood at 93,5 percent, according to the CME Group s FedWatch tool. I do believe that the June rate hike is already priced in so it probably doesn t change what the Fed wants to do, said Neil Massa, senior equity trader at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. I think what it would change, if anything, was the possibility of them accelerating the rate hikes. After this I think it makes them more likely to stay the course than to accelerate.
