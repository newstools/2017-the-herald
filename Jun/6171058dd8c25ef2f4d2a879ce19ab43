Hakainde HichilemaLUSAKA. &#8211; Zambia s opposition leader and UPND president Hakainde Hichilema and five others will face a High Court trial over treason charges and remain in police custody, a magistrate ruled on yesterday. Lusaka Principal Resident Magistrate David Simusamba committed Hakainde Hichilema and his five co-accused to the Lusaka High Court for trial in the offense of treason contrary to section 43 (cap 1) (d) of the penal code chapter 87 of the laws of Zambia.Hichilema was arrested in April for allegedly failing to give way to President Edgar Lungu s motorcade and has so far been held in detention for nearly two months.The incident led to him being accused of endangering President Lungu s life and treason charges followed. I am in court because of hatred. This has everything to do with hatred, Hichilema told journalists inside the courtroom.His lawyers asked the court to throw out the treason charge, arguing it was baseless, but the magistrate referred the case to the High Court with the date for the hearing yet to be announced.Treason suspects are not eligible for bail in Zambia and, if found guilty, Hichilema could face a possible death sentence.Hichilema said he hoped the trial would start soon and criticised the police, accusing them of failing to properly investigate the case. We need a dedicated judge to deal with our matter expeditiously, he said.The treason case comes after Hichilema made a fifth unsuccessful bid for the presidency last year.He refused to recognise Lungu as president and has challenged the narrow poll defeat in court.Meanwhile, there was drama yesterday morning at the Lusaka Magistrate Court when UPND Vice President Geofrey Mwamba was leaving the court hearing after word went round that police were planning to nab him.In a movie like scene, Mwamba was reportedly rescued by four UPND cadres when police attempted to arrest him.He was quickly helped into the vehicle belonging to Dr Nevers Mumba which sped off. &#8211; AFP/Lusaka Times/HR.
