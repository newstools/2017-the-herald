Paul PogbaLONDON. &#8211; Paul Pogba could finally be ready to set the English Premier League alight next soccer season, and Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs believes Red Devils supporters should be excited to see the Frenchman return. Pogba endured a quiet return to English football following his world record transfer from Juventus last summer, as United ended their campaign with a sixth-placed league finish. But Pogba came into his own at the season s end, starring in the Europa League final victory and helping his side to their second piece of competitive silverware.The midfielder s rise was the accentuated during France s 3-2 victory over England at the Stade De France on Tuesday night. Pogba put in an unstoppable performance in central midfield along with Chelsea s N Golo Kante, stifling the Three Lions and sending his side on their way to victory despite having a man sent off.One spectator who was left thoroughly impressed by Pogba s efforts was his former mentor at United Ryan Giggs, who thought the 24-year-old showed that he had everything. Pogba tonight, you ve got to be excited if you re a United fan. You can t wait for next season if he s going to play like that because tonight he had everything, Giggs said during ITV s post-match coverage.Giggs fellow pundits Ian Wright and Lee Dixon were equally in awe of Pogba s show, though Wright lamented the lack of a England challenge to quell his display. You like to see people think hang on a minute, Pogba is on his game here so let s try and get a bit closer to him at least. When they had 10 men it was almost like it evened it up, we didn t have a chance in second half, said Wright. - The Daily Mail.
