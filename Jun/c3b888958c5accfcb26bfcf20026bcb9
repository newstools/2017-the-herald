Sentencing was scheduled for yesterday in federal court in Boston.Cadden was charged in connection with a 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak that was traced to contaminated injections of medical steroids made by the New England Compounding Centre in Framingham.Prosecutors say Cadden ran the centre in a dangerous way by skirting industry regulations on sterility in an effort to push production and make more money.Prosecutors were to ask the judge to sentence him to 35 years in prison. Cadden s lawyer says he should get two and half to three years. &#8211; AP.
