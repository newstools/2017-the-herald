Tariro neGitareArts Reporter Afro-soul artist and visionary Tariro neGitare is set to rebrand the Acoustic Night tomorrow to Magitare Live Acoustic Night at the Harare City Library. Acoustic night is a live performance platform infusing different art forms such as music, poetry and comedy in a safe, family friendly environment.The event has over the years churned out many talented artists and ever since many have continued to fall in love with it. Tariro will share the new vision and direction at the event which is expected to be graced by an audience mix of business leaders, diplomats and artists. The event has been hosted as the Acoustic Night for the last 7 years and it has brought rise to many artists, providing not only a performance platform, but also a professional development opportunity for the artists that we work with, said Tariro. We have decided to rebrand it to the Magitare Live Acoustic Night and will be hosted at the Harare City Library as a move to address the plight of lack of infrastructure and spaces for creatives. We wish to partner with city spaces and transform them creatively so as to maximise existing spaces and use them to bring people together to network and enjoy and celebrate Zimbabwean talent in the process. On its inaugural launch, Magitare Live Acoustic Night is excited to be hosting Nobuntu, an all-female acapella quintet from Bulawayo.Nobuntu has drawn international acclaim for its inventive performances that range from traditional Zimbabwean songs to Afro Jazz to Gospel. The ensemble s concerts are performed with pure voices, augmented by minimalistic percussion, traditional instruments such as the Mbira (thumb piano) and organic, authentic dance movements.It was nominated for Best Musician of the Year at the Zimbabwe International Women Awards in London in 2015 and in the last few seasons, the quintet has performed at festivals and concert halls in Zimbabwe, Italy, Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Canada.The ensemble was a huge critical success at Trans-Vocal in Frankfurt and Voice Mania in Vienna. Their first tour to Canada, in 2016, included performances in Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver, and Victoria.Other awesome artists on the line-up are poet U Mind, musicians Munyaradzi Nyamarebvu, Libert Mathole and Tariro neGitare.
