NEW DELHI. &#8211; Batting great Sunil Gavaskar lamented a sad day yesterday after Anil Kumble stepped down as India cricket coach over a rift with captain Virat Kohli, leaving the hot seat vacant once again. Kumble said his position was untenable after Kohli questioned his leadership style and told the Indian board he had reservations about the spin legend extending his one-year stay.Since Duncan Fletcher left in March 2015, India, currently the world s top Test team, have struggled for stability with Ravi Shastri and Sanjay Bangar both taking on temporary roles before Kumble s reign. I have very little knowledge about the differences between Virat and Anil. But it is a really sad day for Indian cricket, Gavaskar told NDTV. India have won everything since the time Anil took over, he added. I can t see Anil doing much wrong in one year. Differences (can) happen in any team but see the results. India suffered a humiliating defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday, but Kumble also helped them reclaim the number-one Test ranking and maintained an unblemished record in five Test series.Former India captain and coach Bishan Singh Bedi also signalled his disappointment, tweeting: If there s more intelligent/committed Crkt analyser than @anilkumble 1074 on Indn horizon (we are) ignorant really! - AFP.
