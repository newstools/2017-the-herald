Brian Nhira during his performanceAt the Gallery The first International Congress of African Cultures ICAC in 1962 opened up important debates about Africa s underplayed contribution to the global art world as well as the sophistication and holistic nature of the continent s visual culture. The conference sought to show in the midst of Africa, the greatness of African culture in the arts and music and demonstrating the influence of African art and music on 20th Century culture.This brought together African enthusiast including, scholars, museum professionals, directors, artists, poets, writers and critics from around the world.Amongst them Alfred Barr the MoMA director, William Fagg the Keeper of the Department of Anthropology at the British Museum, Tristan Tzara the poet and essayist known mainly as a founder of Dada, Nancy Thomas prominent figure in the British Broadcasting Corporation s Talks Department, Roland Penrose C.B.E Chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Art London, S.O. Okeke of the National Museum of Nigeria and Pierre Guerre who was French Art Critic.The second of this conference aims to look into the past, present and map out the future, from an African perspective, in Africa.This is because as far as African culture and art are concerned, they seem to be largely defined by people who are not African. With the second ICAC slated for September 11 to 13, 2017 in Harare at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe, this week we feature some of the key highlights that will take place during the conference.The conference will run alongside an exhibition programme.The art exhibition by its nature holds a mirror up to society, reflecting its past and present interests and concerns while at the same time challenging ideologies and pre-conceptions.The Gallery has held many exhibitions throughout its 60 year existence which have served as a chronicle of the developments of local art while also stimulating the growth of local artistic talent.The exhibition programme set to run alongside the conference will showcase distinguished artists, both living and late from all over the continent. Some of the exhibitions that delegates can look forward to are the Mapping Zimbabwean Art Exhibition and the African Voices exhibition.The Mapping exhibition presents a visual art history narrative dating back to the earliest art activities of Zimbabwe, while African Voices presents a show of contemporary art from Africa.ICAC will also consist of an optional visit to Great Zimbabwe which is one of the greatest symbols of African Civilisation.The authenticity of the property is unquestionable; particularly the fossil localities which need to remain preserved.At this site, discussion around intangible and tangible heritage will be held.Heritage is anything that is considered important enough to be passed on to the future generations.It gives people a connection to certain social values, beliefs, religions and traditional customs.Heritage conservation has proven to be a thriving place for entrepreneurship and innovation.Also, since the work is labour intensive, it ends up creating more jobs, thus creating employment.There will be an inaugural Art Week which is designed to offer the mushrooming art spaces of Harare an opportunity to celebrate with the National Gallery of Zimbabwe and showcase their work.This will promote Zimbabwe s most contemporary and cutting edge galleries, collectives, craft centres and art related organisations.Art Weeks or fairs are a popular phenomenon across the globe with some of the popular ones being the Cape town Art Week, African Art Week, Venice International Performance Art week, Modern art week, Oxfordshire art week and London Art Fair.With the knowledge that the arts have the potential to boost the economy and create employment, it is of great importance to facilitate platforms and fora in which mushrooming art spaces can showcase their work.People can look forward to mind intriguing and analytical Keynote speakers that will present during the conference.Some of the key note speakers are Olu Oguibe and Thembinkosi Goniwe.Olu Oguibe is a Nigerian born art historian, artist, poet, critic, and assistant professor in the History of Architecture and Art Department of the University of Illinois in Chicago.Oguibe was honoured with the State of Connecticut Governor s Arts Award for excellence and lifetime achievement on 15 June 2013.His critical and theoretical writings have appeared in several key volumes including The Dictionary of Art Reader.
