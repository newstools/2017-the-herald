Ovidy KaruruSports Reporter MIDFIELDER Ovidy Karuru believes he can use the COSAFA Castle Cup to relaunch his international career. The 28-year-old Zimbabwe international feels he still has a lot to offer and is expected to be one of the top players at the tournament following a relatively good season with South Africa First National Division side AmaZulu.Karuru, once a vital cog of the Warriors, has been overlooked in recent years. But he was given a new lease of life by interim Warriors coach Norman Mapeza and playing a cameo role in Zimbabwe s AFCON qualifier against Liberia recently.And now Sunday Chidzambwa has given him another opportunity. The AmaZulu midfielder believes the regional tournament will be a perfect stage for him to relaunch himself. It s a good competition especially for the youngsters because this team is full of guys who are coming up, said Karuru. I think they should take it seriously, maybe they will get contracts outside the country. I encourage them to focus on the tournament and give it their best. For me, as someone who is coming back to his best, I also have to take the competition seriously. You never know who is watching, so I have to take every game seriously. The coach has emphasised that he has never lost a game in COSAFA. He has encouraged us to win the tournament for him because he said he has never lost. So it s a direct challenge to the players. We would want to go all the way to the final, but I think it s not going to be easy. We have to push, especially the youngsters, because for most of them it s their first time playing such a tournament.
