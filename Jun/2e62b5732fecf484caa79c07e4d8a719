Bengaluru. Gold edged lower yesterday as investors awaited cues on market direction amid a number of geopolitical events later in the day that could boost the safe-haven demand for the metal. Polls opened in the UK national elections yesterday while the European Central Bank (ECB) was expected to discuss dropping additional stimulus pledges at a meeting later; and former US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey will testify before the US Congress about his interactions with President Donald Trump later in the day. A lot of things are happening at the same time&#8230; There may be some kind of impact that may push up the volatility rather than the direction of price moves, said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong s Wing Fung Financial Group. Gold is likely to fluctuate somewhere between the $1 280 to $1 300 range, he said.Spot gold was down 0,2 percent, to $1 284,24 per ounce at 4.39am GMT. US gold futures for August delivery dipped 0,5 percent to $1 286,80 an ounce. Gold fell from a near seven-month high on Wednesday after Comey s written testimony to the US Senate contained few surprises.Comey s testimony did say President Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
