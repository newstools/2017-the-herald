Tafadzwa MukaroArts Reporter The much touted launch of rising gospel diva Tafadzwa Mukaro s new video for the song Ndashanda has come and gone, leaving excitement in its wake. That is not least because the artiste exhibited growth in her skills from the ordinary run of the mill type gospel music video making to serious professional scripting.Put together by director Slim Magombedze, the video has been warmly received for its subtle lyrics, catchy refrain as well as its overall freshness. The choreography had to be scripted and not look like the typical gospel video from days gone by but exhibit the seriousness of the audience we want to capture, minister to and entertain without being overly preachy, says her husband and manager Wisdom Mukaro.And the video does well to capture the mood of that mission. Ndashanda , a workers anthem with religious overtones has Tafadzwa celebrating her hard work, energy and tireless dedication whether in rain or shine, heat or cold, day or night in order to carve out a comfortable life for her and her family.And as the chorus kikikiriki explains, working for a living is an epic gruelling battle in the modern world. We are happy with the reception of the video and the choreography and effort of shooting with professional and lay real-life workers made the experience worth the while and refreshing, he added.After releasing the song in the beginning of the year, the gem of a video says it was well worth the wait ahead of the release of the full album hopefully by year end.
