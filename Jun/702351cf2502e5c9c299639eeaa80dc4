MOGADISHU. &#8211; The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) said it would help stabilise and boost security in Somalia, despite increased terror attacks from Al-Shabaab militants. The Special Representative of the AU Commission Chairperson (SRCC) for Somalia, Francisco Madeira, lauded Somali national security forces for swift response to the terrorist attack on a hotel and a restaurant in Mogadishu on Wednesday. The act of bravery exhibited by the security forces must be commended and is proof that the reforms being undertaken by the government under the new National Security Architecture Agreement are taking shape and beginning to show positive results, Madeira said in a statement. The attack on Pizza House restaurant and Posh hotel left at least 18 people dead and 19 others injured.Al-Shabaab militants have claimed responsibility for the attack, which was triggered by a suicide car bomber and targeted customers who frequent the restaurant and adjacent hotel.Six militants who seized control of the restaurant including a suicide bomber were subsequently killed by Somali security forces. Madeira said the attack on civilians on Wednesday night was a desperate attempt by the terrorists seeking public attention, after having suffered serious losses from recent operations by Somali government forces.The AU envoy said the ongoing security operation under the stabilisation campaign in Mogadishu and others targeting Al-Shabaab camps have left the militants severely weakened. AMISOM commends the government forces for their courage and pledges its continued support towards ensuring total pacification of Somalia, said Madeira.He commended the Somali government for the ongoing operations to seize illegal firearms in Mogadishu and other major towns to help secure the country. The unity and resilience of the people of Somalia shall win over those that seek to spread terror by disregarding the sanctity of human life, Madeira said. &#8211; Xinhua.
