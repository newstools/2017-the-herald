BIRMINGHAM. Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed said playing in front of a home crowd had helped inspire his side to a shock 19-run win over South Africa in the Champions Trophy at Edgbaston on Wednesday. Pakistan went from zeroes to heroes in three days, bouncing back from a 124-run thrashing by arch-rivals India to topple the world s No 1-ranked ODI side.Pakistan fans dominated a crowd of more than 16 000, giving it the air of a home game for Sarfraz s men in Birmingham, a city with one of the largest Asian populations in Britain. That is a feeling we miss, not playing in Pakistan, said Sarfraz. Maybe that was a difference, the crowd was supporting us and that s why the players were boosted. Pakistan have had to play most of their matches overseas since a 2009 terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore.But chants of Pakistan Zindabad! ( Long live Pakistan! ) rang round Edgbaston which was turned into a sea of green. Sarfraz s side gave their fans reason to cheer when spinners Imad Wasim and Mohammad Hafeez took three early wickets before paceman Hasan Ali removed a trio of middle-order batsmen.Pakistan kept the Proteas to a modest 219 for eight in their 50 overs, having conceded exactly 100 more against title-holders India. I think the difference was our bowling and fielding, said wicketkeeper-captain Sarfraz. Mohammad Hafeez and Imad Wasim bowled really well and they took the pressure off for us, he said. AFP.
