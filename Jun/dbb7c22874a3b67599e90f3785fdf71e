Cristiano RonaldoKAZAN. Copa America champions Chile will try to curb Portugal s superstar Cristiano Ronaldo in today s Confederations Cup semi-final with the goal-ace in rich form despite a tax storm brewing in Spain. The match kicks-off at 8pm. The 32-year-old Ronaldo converted a penalty in Saturday s 4-0 thrashing of New Zealand to claim his 75th international goal.The Real Madrid forward has now scored 16 times in his last 10 games for club and country. Portugal s captain will face tax evasion charges in a Madrid court next month, but has dazzled on the pitch in Russia, claiming man-of-the-match awards in all three games, netting two goals and providing an assist.After steering Portugal to the Euro 2016 title in Paris a year ago, Ronaldo will want to claim a second international title in Sunday s Confed Cup final in St Petersburg, against Mexico or Germany who meet in the other semi-final.
