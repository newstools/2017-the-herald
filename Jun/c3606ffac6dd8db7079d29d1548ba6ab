Claudio RanieriNANTES. Claudio Ranieri insists his incredible achievements at Leicester City count for nothing now that he has taken over at sleeping French soccer giants Nantes, where he was unveiled as their new coach on Monday. I have missed being out on the pitch. But we must forget what I did at Leicester. What we achieved there was unique. It is not the same here, said the 65-year-old Italian at a press conference.Ranieri has signed a two-year contract with the Ligue 1 side to return to coaching for the first time since his sacking by Leicester in February.He was dismissed by the English club less than a year after leading them to a fairytale Premier League title triumph in 2016 and now returns to France, where he previously worked in charge at Monaco.Nantes are historically one of France s most successful sides, but last won the title in 2001 and have often struggled in the years since.
