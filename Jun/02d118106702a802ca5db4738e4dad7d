LONDON. &#8211; Antoine Griezmann has signed a new deal with Atletico Madrid &#8211; but has left the door open for a move to Manchester United . Griezmann has been given a massive pay-hike by Atletico Madrid as part of a new contract that ties him to the club until 2022.But the Frenchman has resisted the club s attempt to raise his buy-out clause and will cost Manchester United the same 100m ( 88m) fee he would have cost them this summer if they come back in for him next year.The 26-year-old Frenchman moves into the big pay league with a salary estimated to be worth 14million net a season, at 12.3million that means he will pick up around 235 000 a week net. That is short of the 300 000 United were understood to be prepared to pay him. But the deal makes him Atletico Madrid s top earner and leaves him trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar in La Liga. Atletico Madrid have been able to make the huge financial commitment because their spending in the transfer market this summer has been massively curtailed by the Fifa ban on registering new players until 2018. &#8211; AFP.
