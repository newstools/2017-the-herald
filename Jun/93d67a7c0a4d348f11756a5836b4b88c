Nowhere is the dictum prevention is better than cure more accurate than in the context of IT security for businesses. In many instances, the need to cut costs has gradually taken precedence over the need for secured IT and data backups. Unlike securing physical company assets such as office premises, vehicles or machinery and unlike securing physical documents in locked up filing cabinets the securing of IT systems and data is usually low on the priority list.In recent weeks, several high-profile IT-related disasters have exposed the lack of disaster preparedness within companies across the globe and highlighted the role of user error or negligence in making IT systems vulnerable to security breaches.Incidents such as the massive WannaCry ransomware attack which affected thousands of companies in over 100 countries on May 13 to incidents like the grounding of British Airways flights on May 27 owing to a major IT systems failure underscore that the era of cyber-disaster is upon us.In the case of British Airways, the IT disaster was attributed to a power-supply issue, which demonstrates how IT disasters come in many forms from ransomware to power outages.Disaster can strike at any time therefore IT security should be a priority always.
