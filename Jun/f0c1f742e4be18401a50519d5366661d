Innocent Ruwende Senior Reporter A tribunal tasked to investigate alleged defiance by Harare City Council executives to cut salaries in line with a Government directive has begun its work.Council officials had refused to appear before the tribunal chaired by retired High Court judge Justice George Smith. They claimed that they had not been informed of the composition of the tribunal. The officials also alleged that they had not been furnished with the tribunal s terms of reference. Some of the officials have appeared before the tribunal and only got to know some of the members during the proceedings, but they were not given its terms of reference, said a source.Mayor Councillor Bernard Manyenyeni refused to disclose the composition of the tribunal. The Herald is reliably informed that it is composed of Mr Puwai Chiutsi of P Chiutsi and Associates, Meikles human resources manager Ms Thandiwe Tshuma, Chartered Accountant and accomplished investment banker, Ms Jennifer Makasi-Shava and Mr Adley Mubaiwa.Cllr Manyenyeni said he would avail the terms of reference of the tribunal to the city officials. I have avoided getting involved with the tribunal to protect its independence, he said. The tribunal was given a month to carry out its mandate after a Government audit unearthed financial irregularities at Town House.According to the audit report sanctioned by the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, city executives continued to earn between $12 000 and $21 000 from October 2014 to June 2015, as opposed to $10 450 for the highest earner as stipulated by the Government. This prejudiced council of $550 000.
