AUCKLAND. Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones will lead the British and Irish Lions against the Canterbury Crusaders tomorrow with tour captain Sam Warburton not even named to the bench for the third game of their 10-match tour of New Zealand. Warburton suffered a knee injury in April and did not play again until leading the Lions in their unconvincing 13-7 victory over the Provincial Barbarians in the tour opener last Saturday.Ireland s openside flanker Sean O Brien has been given the nod for the number seven jersey and will make his first appearance of the tour, with compatriot Peter O Mahony named at blindside flanker.Lions coach Warren Gatland had said all 41 members of the squad would get an opportunity to play in the opening three games of the tour before he began to decide on combinations for the first test against the All Blacks on June 24.While Wednesday s 22-16 defeat to the Auckland Blues was far from ideal, Gatland said the squad was on the right track. Last night s result against the Blues was disappointing, Gatland said in a statement. The aim was always to start everyone in the first three matches and this selection ensures that we achieve this. Our squad is working hard and we are seeing improvement in their performances both at training and in the games. Gatland s lineup for tomorrow will see nine of the starting 15 having played on the 2013 tour to Australia.To combat the All Blacks-laden pack of the Crusaders, with six of the eight players having test experience, Gatland has given props Tadhg Furlong and Mako Vunipola their first starts of the tour.
