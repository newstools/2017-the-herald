As the WAR, our mission is to provide a platform that equitably facilitates scholarship and professional opportunities for African athletes from all backgrounds. We intend to achieve that through our digital marketing platforms and scouting events that increase the athletes visibility and marketability whilst also providing recruiting opportunities for all scouts like this event at Lord Malvern. We are targeting children between 13 and 20 years. It is my hope that we will achieve our aim, he said.Besides the United States scout, several other local Premiership and lower division clubs will be sniffing around for potential targets with Dynamos and Ngezi Platinum having already confirmed their presence at the tourney.Ndemera said his company has also attracted some corporate partners.Several high-profile players will also witness the event whose guest of honour will be the 1996 Soccer Star of the Year, Stewart Shutto Murisa.
