Fungai Lupande Herald Reporter No child in Mudzi District, Mashonaland East, has qualified for the Government s science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) programme due to the dilapidated state of schools in the area, Mudzi West legislature Cde Magna Mudyiwa said yesterday. Speaking at the launch of Chifamba Old Students Association (Cosa), Cde Mudyiwa said students in Mudzi did not do well in sciences because their laboratories were in a sorry state.Chifamba Primary School was built in 1945, while the high school was built in 1981. A laboratory at Chifamba High School is in a sorry state and computers are dilapidated, said Cde Mudyiwa. We have only two Advanced Level schools in Mudzi, one of which has only one A-Level block. We do not have a child who qualified for STEM in Mudzi because the students did not do well in sciences. We also do not have a boarding school in the area and many A-Level students come from far away places and they end up renting accommodation. Cde Mudyiwa said some teenagers ended up pregnant and dropping out of school.He urged Government and other stakeholders to help develop Mudzi.Provincial education director for Mashonaland East Mr Christopher Chihota said he was proud that Cosa was ploughing back into the community. Development of Mudzi comes from its people, he said. Let us not look for donors because they are no longer there. You are lucky that your Chief advocates for education. Chief Nyamukoho is not an ordinary chief, but he is also a qualified teacher. Chifamba High School head Mr Rutendo Mukanda said a classroom block built by parents 10 years ago was still not roofed. This school is the pride of Mudzi, but we are losing our pride due to the dilapidated state of our school, he said.The school has 450 pupils.Cosa, led by lawyer Farai Katonga and his twin brother Tendai, said they draw inspiration from President Mugabe s Kutama Old Boys Association.The organisation donated 30 desks to the school.
