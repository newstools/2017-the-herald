The calendar will also guide farmers on the application of herbicides; coordinated harvesting, timely collection of harvested maize and other farm produce from collection points and drying of the maize to free fields for winter wheat and barley, he said.Cde Mnangagwa said migration from summer to winter was sometimes so close that winter set in before summer crops attained the moisture content required by the Grain Marketing Board. We are now working with the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development to help farmers to migrate from summer to winter by providing crop dryers countrywide to release the land for the winter crop. We believe by next year winter, we would have done a lot to relieve farmers of those challenges. The calendar will also guide land preparation for the winter crop or any other crops falling in the same season. The calendar should be communicated to all stakeholders including tillage service providers as well as lime, seed and fertiliser suppliers, he said.He applauded farmers for doing well during the 2016/17 season and said although there were challenges, the country had produced enough food to feed itself. The potential for this country to produce food not for its people but for the region is there. Zimbabwean people who should do that are there, the land is there, water is there so what is not there for us to achieve that status? he asked.He said Command Agriculture was a success although it faced challenges such as the late disbursement of inputs, fall armyworm outbreak and too much continuous rain in parts of the country. Inspite of these challenges, the assessment by the Ministry of Agriculture assures us that we are going to have enough food for ourselves and say bye bye to the importation of maize for Zimbabwe, he said.Cde Mnangagwa expressed gratitude to President Mugabe for providing guidance and leadership in the agricultural initiative. During the State of the Nation Address on August 25, 2015, his Excellency the President outlined a 10-Point Plan for economic growth wherein he stated, inter- alia, the need to revitalise agriculture and the agro-processing value chain, advance beneficiation and value addition to our agricultural and mining resources endowments as well as establishing joint ventures and pubic-private partnerships to boost the role and performance of State-owed companies, he said.
