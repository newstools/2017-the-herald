Collen TimoeArts Correspondent Growing up in Nyabira, gospel musician Collen Timoe aka Mr Timz could not realise his talent because of lack of exposure. Though he had the talent, he could not make it until he worked with his late brother, Kennedy Murakata, who was a sungura musician. They even participated in Chibuku Road to Fame competitions but their alliance did not last long as Timz s parents persuaded him to continue with his education. Timio went further with his education, graduating with the University of Zimbabwe.It was not until 2015 that he realised that he had the potential tomake big as a gspel musician and recorded his first album Namata Musiki , with the track Gadziriro Yemweya doing well on the local market. Since then he has been doing live shows and he has shared the stage with several musiciansamong them Blessing Shumba. So to just have something on the market we released a single Jehova Mufudzi Wangu and it is already out, he said. They are almost done with the eight-track album that has songs Jehova , Gadziriro Yemweya , Mambo Wekudenga and Urikubatei among other tracks. We are almost done with the album that will be recorded live. I have realised that it will be easy when we record live and our live shows will come out well, he said.He said the new album will have videos. Each gospel brand needs some videos and we are working to have the best videos ever. I am glad that people will be happy too if we come up with good videos complementing the word of God from our songs, he said.He wishes to have collaborations with several other musicians that include South African gospel artistes. We want all that for our brand and I am happy that it is taking shape, he said.
