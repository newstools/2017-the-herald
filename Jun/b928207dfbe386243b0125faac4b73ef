It was a very tough competition but I feel honoured to be recognised outside my country. It is always an honour to have people who speak a different language appreciating your music. It also gives me a chance to visit a lot of places. This year I have been to the US and the UK where I was nominated for the African Gospel Music Awards, he said.Tembalami who has three albums to his name and a latest single which he released a few months ago is working on his fourth album which has collaborations with some of Africa s talented artistes. I am doing a collaboration with Evelyn Wanjiru and one of the biggest producers in Kenya. All in all, I will be doing three different Kenyan collaborations which will be on my upcoming album so I am very excited, said Tembalami.There is a lot to look forward to from the talented musician and his fast growing music career. I am still building my brand and doing these international collaborations to market my music. From me, you can always expect excellence, more music and tours. This year I will be going back to the US then Australia and a lot of other places, said Tembalami.
