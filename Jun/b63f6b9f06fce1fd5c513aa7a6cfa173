MOSCOW. &#8211; Cameroon need to improve their football infrastructure if they want to compete with the world s top teams, coach Hugo Broos said following their Confederations Cup exit. Despite winning the African Cup of Nations in February, Broos added that the five-time continental champions had to stop living on their past success and face reality.Cameroon were knocked out of the tournament in Russia on Sunday after a 3-1 defeat to Germany left them with one point from three matches, an outcome which Broos said he had been expecting.The Indomitable Lions are also struggling to qualify for next year s World Cup, having taken only two points from their first two games in African Group B to leave them four behind leaders Nigeria. Only the winners qualify. It was not a surprise for me. I always said after we won the Nations Cup that we are one of the best teams in Africa but there is still a difference between us and modern football, Broos told reporters after Sunday s defeat. We saw the proof that a lot of work still needs to be done . . . it is, of course, a quality issue, but it s mostly a training issue, the Belgian said. There is a lot to be done on that front in Cameroon, we still live on our past successes. &#8211; Reuters.
