The lawmakers from the United Party for National Development (UPND) avoided Lungu s address, claiming he was not the legitimate winner of the contested August 11 elections.Parliament Speaker Patrick Matibini said they should quit if they did not accept Lungu as the head of state. I challenge you to resign on moral grounds if you do not recognise that there is a legitimately-elected government, said Matibini. I have, in exercise of my powers, decided to suspend the 48 members of parliament from service for a period of 30 days with effect from today. Matibini said the lawmakers would not be paid or have access to the parliament building or lodgings during their suspension. Tuesday s decision is the latest in a long-running battle between Zambia s government and the principal opposition.
