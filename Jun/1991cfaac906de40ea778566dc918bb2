Antoine GriezmannLONDON. Manchester United have cooled their interest in Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann. United were keen on the France forward and were considering whether to trigger his 100m euro ( 87m) escape clause. However, a source close to United said Griezmann, 26, is no longer a priority. It is understood the long-term injury to Zlatan Ibrahimovic has forced the club to change their priorities, with doubts over the Swede s future beyond the expiry of his contract on 30 June. No decision has yet been made over an extension but, given he is unlikely to play until January, the odds are against him being offered a new deal.United are now thought to be targeting a main striker rather than a number 10, believing they already have enough players to fill that role. After his side beat Ajax to win the Europa League last week, manager Jose Mourinho said executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has had his targets for more than two months .Atletico have had their transfer ban upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, meaning they would not be able to replace Griezmann until January should he leave this summer.
