Lovemore Chikova China-Africa Focus The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF) held in Beijing, China, mid last month was an eye opener to progressive international co-operation. The forum proved that China is committed to ensuring free and inclusive trade, not only for its benefit, but for the uplifting of the world economy. The massive forum was attended by 29 Heads of State and Government from across the world, as well as leaders of key international organisations. The outcome of the forum is set to change how the world conducts its business, emphasising how influential China has become in international affairs.The list of deliverables from the forum is comprehensive, comprising 76 items and over 270 concrete results in five key areas. The key areas are policy, infrastructure, trade, financial and people-to-people connectivity.The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road, also known as the Belt and Road Initiative or the Belt and Road was proposed by the Chinese President and unveiled in 2013.It focuses on connectivity and cooperation between China and other countries following the traditional routes of trade and cooperation that have existed for centuries.The initiative links China with all other continents, as the Asian country exerts its influence in global affairs and its desire to ensure win-win cooperation in inter-state relations.The important cooperation initiative is meant to build the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. To date, steady progress and fruitful results have been achieved in the implementation of the initiative and the international community has welcomed it and its positive impact.The forum held in Beijing is a major international event for countries and parties concerned to engage in consultation on building the Belt and Road and sharing the benefits. It is also an important platform for the participating parties to strengthen cooperation and synergise their development strategies.Before and during the BRF, national governments, local authorities and enterprises reached a number of cooperation agreements, policy measures and practical results.Through the initiative, China wants to ensure that growth in the world economy is based on common good and that it benefits all. The initiative has already yielded positive results. According to Chinese news agency, Xinhua, at least 68 countries and international organisations have so far signed agreements with China on Belt and Road cooperation.The total trade between China and other Belt and Road countries exceeded $3 trillion between 2014 and 2016, and Chinese investment in these countries surpassed $50 billion.A multi-dimensional infrastructure network is taking shape, one that is underpinned by economic corridors featuring land-sea-air transportation routes and information expressways and supported by major rail, port and pipeline projects.It is clear that the Belt and Road is set to bring win-win results in the world, and in the process lift millions of people out of poverty, raise living standards and connect the world in a way never before seen.The initiative has been most welcome by enterprises throughout the world which view it as an opportunity to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa, along and beyond the ancient trade routes.President Xi made it clear at the forum that the Belt and Road Initiative does not exclude or target any party, and we need to seek win-win results through greater openness and cooperation, avoid fragmentation, refrain from setting inhibitive thresholds for cooperation or pursing exclusive arrangements, and reject protectionism.This reasoning is set to transform how countries treat each other for the mutual benefit of all.Xinhua quoted Ignacio Martinez Cortes, head of the Research Laboratory for Trade, Economy and Business, as saying the BRF strengthened international trade ties and sought new channels of distributing goods to bring about mutual benefit for all.
