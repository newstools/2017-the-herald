LONDON. &#8211; Pakistan are ready to change the course of history in a clash that s bigger than the Ashes when they face cricket arch-rivals India in the Champions Trophy final. Some estimates suggest tomorrow s match between the sub-continental cricket giants at the Oval in south London could attract a worldwide television audience of more than a billion viewers.Title-holders India will be firm favourites against a Pakistan side who were the lowest ranked of all the teams taking part in a tournament featuring the world s top-eight one-day international sides.It was only on June 4 that India launched their title defence with a 124-run rout of Pakistan at Edgbaston. Yet even by their own unpredictable standards, Pakistan s transformation since that reverse has been remarkable and on Wednesday they knocked previously unbeaten tournament hosts England out of the competition with a comprehensive eight-wicket win in Cardiff.Pakistan have yet to play a match at the Oval this tournament but in bowling coach Azhar Mahmood, who spent several seasons at his second home playing for Surrey, they have someone familiar with all the vagaries of the London ground. &#8211; AFP.
