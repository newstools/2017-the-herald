Manny PacquiaoBRISBANE. &#8211; Australian challenger Jeff Horn has made a massive blunder by not training against superior sparring partners in the United States in preparation for Sunday s boxing title fight, Manny Pacquiao s team says. The legendary 38-year-old Filipino, one of the greatest fighters of his generation, is widely tipped to overcome the unbeaten Horn in front of an expected 50 000 people at Brisbane s Suncorp Stadium. Pacquiao s Australian strength and conditioning coach Justin Fortune said yesterday the Fighting Schoolteacher hasn t done his homework and will be outclassed by the master eight-weight world champion. Manny is one of the greats and Jeff Horn is in a different league, former heavyweight Fortune told reporters. If Manny puts his mind to it he destroys anybody in the world. He s busted up some of the greats. Jeff Horn is the guy to knock out and we re in the hurt business. Fortune, who once fought against Lennox Lewis, said Horn should have spent eight weeks in America against the best available sparring partners. Then you might have given him a real shot if he d been training with A-grade guys all the time, he said. Instead he s been using (Filipino) Czar Amonsot as a sparring partner and he is nowhere near as fast as Manny. &#8211; AFP.
