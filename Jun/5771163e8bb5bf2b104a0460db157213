LONDON. &#8211; Arsenal and Manchester City are weighing up a sensational straight swap of superstar strikers Alexis Sanchez and Sergio Aguero. But Aguero s agent has insisted that his client will stay at Manchester City this summer, much to the disappointment of French side Paris Saint-Germain. However, discussions have been held about the South Americans switching clubs this summer.City boss Pep Guardiola had made former Barcelona hitman Sanchez (29) his No.1 striker target this summer.Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has insisted there is no way he will let Sanchez, who scored 31 times for Arsenal last season, leave this summer despite the Chile ace having just a year left on his contract.But with Sanchez keen to leave a striker swap for Aguero could be the perfect solution for both clubs.Arsenal have been told by Lyon chief executive Jean-Michel Aulas they must come up with 57million if they are to land France international Alexandre Lacazette, making Aguero an even more attractive alternative.Despite scoring 33 times for the Etihad club last season the Argentine, who is also 29, has failed to totally convince Guardiola in the Spaniard s first season at City. At times during the campaign Guardiola dropped Aguero, favouring Gabriel Jesus instead.Aguero would be guaranteed a starting place at Arsenal although he would have to miss out on Champions League football, with Wenger s men only qualifying for the Europa League after finishing fifth.In April Guardiola hinted Aguero had found it hard to adapt to his football philosophy saying: Maybe he understands now more what we are looking for. A swap deal involving Aguero and Sanchez would be the most stunning straight exchange ever seen in the Premier League, but could prove ideal for both of the big-hitters.Paris St-Germain are also keen on Aguero but it is understood the Argentine prefers to stay in the Premier League.Former Arsenal striker and current TV pundit Ian Wright has claimed the Manchester City star is just what the club need to end their 13 year title drought. &#8211; The Daily Star-The Independent.
