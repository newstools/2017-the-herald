There seem to be less mbira shows these days because the genre now has fewer followers than a few years ago. We believe mbira should not die since this is music that truly reflects our culture. We want to ensure that the genre keeps growing through inspiring young musicians to pursue mbira. The only way to do so is to organise mbira shows regularly and remind people that this is our music that should live forever, noted the organisers.After tonight s show Masike will travel to the Eastern Highlands for Vumba Art and Craft Fair at Ndundu Lodge tomorrow.The show is being organised by Friends of Vumba, an organisation that focuses of preserving wildlife in the Eastern Highlands.
