Even if I feel heaviness in my soul, the song Lift the Name inspires me and I feel motivated, he said.The upcoming artiste also finds inspiration from Corinthians 13 verse 1-5, in which God teaches about love. We should be surrounded by love, our environment, background, and wherever we go. We should learn to love as God is the first to give His love by giving us His only Son to die for us.The catering student at Harare Polytechnic Munya has been doing live shows at Faith Ministries.
