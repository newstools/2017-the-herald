KINGSTON. Usain Bolt overcame a rare bout of nerves and a slow start to produce a winning farewell in front of his home fans in Jamaica on Saturday. The sprint great, winner of eight Olympic gold medals, will retire from competitive athletics after the World Championships in London in August. His final race in Kingston, at a meeting featuring most of the world s leading athletes, attracted a crowd of more than 30 000, including the island s Prime Minister Andrew Holness and IAAF president Sebastian Coe.Bolt was slowly out of the blocks but quickly took command of the race and crossed the line in 10.03 seconds before making an emotional victory lap in front of his adoring fans. I don t think I ve ever been that nervous running a 100m. I think that was possibly one of my worst races. My execution was poor, my start was poor as always. I think in the last bit I lost it a little, Bolt said. Sky Sports.
