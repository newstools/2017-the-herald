Isaiah 32 vs 18; My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation, in secure homes, and in quiet resting places. Overtime I have noticed that regardless of where one may come from, home is home. Our spirit somehow reconciles to the fact that God has designated this specific place to be the place of your origin. With this you develop an infinite love for the space that you call home, regardless of the conditions. It could be drought prone, with very high temperatures or it could be very cold to the point of discomfort, home is home .When the children of Israel where exiled they sang songs of the place they knew to be home and how much they longed to go back,hence the popular song that goes like this; By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered Zion Let s pray for the places we call home, may the Lord continue to look after them and more importantly, may His encompassing protection allow our countries to prosper, because He can make all things beautiful.May the Lord give guidance to the countries we call home.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on [email&#160;protected]; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
