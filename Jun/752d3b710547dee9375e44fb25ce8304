It is a time to have fun with fans during the retreat and we are all looking forward to it. Last year we had a time to visit Nyanga Hospital and we donated some stuff. It was for fun and also for a good cause, said Mataure. We are happy to rope in Alexio for this concert. We have worked with a number of young musicians at this event and they have all done well. We also promise a surprise this year and people should be ready for something exciting. Other musicians that have performed at the event include Ammara Brown, Tariro NeGitare and Roki.

All is now set for the event. The golfers have registered for the tournament and the stage is set for the concert.
