We want to thank the senior party leadership here for coming to this meeting as well as for the guidance and advice they are giving to us. They have welcomed the President many times before us and know better. We thank them for the organisational and logistical support they are giving us, even though the event is for the Youth League, Cde Chipanga added.In his remarks Cde Hungwe said tomorrow s rally was mainly a day for President Mugabe to interact with the youths in the province, saying the Head of State and Government was supposed to be accorded more time to talk to young people from from Masvingo.Sen Mahofa has already urged organisers of the rally to make sure the majority of people at the interface rally were young people as they rarely had the opportunity to interact with their leader.After the meeting Cde Chipanga led senior ruling party officials on a tour of the venue of the rally at the open arena outside Mucheke Stadium, where officials expressed satisfaction with the state of preparedness.Zanu PF Masvingo Youth League chair Cde Nobert Ndaarombe, said everthing was in place for the rally with pitching of VVIP tents and clearing of vehicle parking places having been completed.He said water and power had also been installed at the venue together with WIFI services for easy communication access at the venue.Masvingo youths have already said they will take advantage of the President s rally to push for a larger share of the cake in two major projects that were recently commissioned by the Head of State and Government in Masvingo.The youths want to be major beneficiaries of irrigation opportunities to be engendered by Tokwe-Mukosi Dam, while also getting employment opportunities at the Beitbridge &#8211; Harare highway dualisation project.
