Herald Reporter Tanzania Commission for Aids (TACAIDS) has hailed Zimbabwe for maintaining the National Aids Trust Fund, popularly known as the Aids Levy, saying it was the only sustainable homegrown solution of funding HIV and Aids programmes. Speaking after touring the National Blood Services Zimbabwe (NBSZ) together with six other delegates in Harare on Wednesday, TACAIDS executive director Dr Leonard Maboko, said his organisation sought to understand the modalities of the Aids Levy.Dr Maboko said although Tanzania had set up an HIV Trust Fund, it was funded mainly from the national budget and fundraising events. For Zimbabwe, you must be applauded how you have sustained the Aids levy. So we are here to learn and use your experience to have negotiations with our Government on possibility of establishing an Aids levy, which is a more sustainable way of increasing domestic funding for Aids, said Dr Maboko.He said the other option of funding their Trust Fund through fundraising activities was not sustainable. But here what we have learnt, which I have to congratulate your country for many years you have maintained the Aids Levy, which is sustainable. Fundraising events are totally not sustainable. Speaking at the same occasion, National Aids Council communications director Ms Madelina Dube, said this was the third time the Tanzanians were visiting the country to learn more on establishing and operationalising the Trust Fund.Ms Dube said since their initial visit, the team had since established its Trust Fund, which was launched during their World Aids Day 2016 commemorations. The delegation has come as a team to understand the policies in place, which has enabled us to set up the NATF, to run with it and be a success, said Ms Dube. NBSZ spokesperson Ms Esther Massundah, said the organisation was happy to receive the Tanzanians because of the link between blood transfusions and HIV.She said it was therefore important for them to understand how NBSZ collaborated with NAC.The team is expected to leave the country for Tanzania on Friday.
