MOSCOW. &#8211; The Russian army yesterday said it was seeking to verify whether Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed after its warplanes hit the group s leaders in a night raid in Syria last month. The United States said it could not immediately confirm Baghdadi s death. In a statement, the army said Sukhoi warplanes carried out a 10-minute strike early on May 28 at a location near Raqa, where IS leaders had gathered to plan a pullout by militants from the group s stronghold. Senior commanders of the military groups of the so-called IS military council, 30 mid-ranking field commanders and up to 300 militants who provided security for them were eliminated, it said. &#8211; AFP.
