Sports Reporter IN-FORM CAPS United midfielder Ronald Rooney Chitiyo has won the appreciation of the club s supporters after he was voted the club s Player of the Month for May. The award is being bankrolled by the team s fans. Chitiyo distinguished himself in a month of mixed fortunes for the club both at home and on the continent.The Green Machine played four games, two in the local league and as many CAF Champions League encounters. The month opened with them losing 0-2 away to Egyptian giants Zamalek in a Group B opener in Alexandria. ZPC Kariba compounded the champions woes when they handed them a 2-1 defeat in a Castle Lager PSL contest at Nyamhunga.But, Makepekepe somehow found a way to turn it around as they defied the odds to beat Algerian champions USM Alger 2-1 at the National Sports Stadium on May 24 with Chitiyo netting both goals.Another setback on the local front followed as they were held to a 1-1 draw away at Triangle that concluded the May business.Chitiyo was happy after receiving the award together with groceries worth over $200 from the fans representative Tongai Mutongi. It feels good to see your efforts being recognised. I also want to salute my teammates and the coach who all work hard for the team. I would want to promise the fans that the team will do everything in their ability to retain the league and possibly progress to the last eight of the Champions league, he said.
