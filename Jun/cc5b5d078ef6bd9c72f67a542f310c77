Paidamoyo Chipunza in KWEKWE The Southern Africa Aids Trust is appealing for funding to nationalise its integrated programme on HIV and Aids, cervical cancer and prostate cancer screening and treatment. Speaking to Members of Parliament from the thematic committee on HIV and Aids and the portfolio committee of Health and Child Care during a tour of Silobela District Hospital in Kwekwe on Thursday, the organisation s country director Mrs Giva Roselyn Dete said it cost about $10 000 to set up a model one-stop shop for cancer and HIV services. A crayogun machine used to kill early stage cancerous cells costs $600, a Leep set for advanced cancer costs about $2 000 while an ultra sound scan machine costs about $7 000, said Mrs Dete.She said the set made it possible to integrate cancer services into already existing HIV services.The integrated approach is only available in the Midlands Province. We are appealing for more funding to acquire more machines to set up similar facilities in all provinces of the country, she said.Mrs Dete said although cancer screening services where available at some public health institutions, the SAT project sought to integrate cancer and HIV services since they were linked.NAC director for communication, Ms Madelin Dube, said integration of HIV and cancer services was paramount, as 60 percent of cancer patients had HIV.Senator for Zvishavane Lilian Timveos, who is a survivor of cervical cancer, gave a testimony on the importance of ensuring early access to treatment.
