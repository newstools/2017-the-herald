Industrial Automation is the past, present and future of industrial development, not only in the country but also on global scale. There is an increased reliance on automated systems and evidence of a steady boost in productivity, efficiency and business to client interactions. Industrial automation is undeniably the key to explosive growth through technology; with adaptive systems which can measure, control and monitor all aspects of human existence and interaction.There has been steady progress towards fully automated factories with the use of intelligent robots, sophisticated machines, online customer interactions and transactions.With the development of such automated systems, the fundamental question is whether manufacturing will still require people. And the answer is a resounding, yes.Automated machines need people to design, programme and maintain them; which is where the highly competitive degree programmes offered by the Harare Institute of Technology become relevant.The Department of Industrial &amp; Manufacturing has a diverse range of skills and capabilities to respond to the issues of Industrial Automation.Over the 12 years of the departments existence, several projects within the arena of Industrial Automation have been developed, and more than 150 graduates have been armed with the acumen of the field.They have been viable arsenal in transforming and sustaining the automation, beverage and cement industries in Harare, Mashonaland West, Bulawayo and Manicaland Provinces.This year, the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering will host the second International Conference on the 25th and 26th of October.The conference provides a platform where experts from around the globe will showcase their world class research and practice in Industrial Automation (visit www.iconiazim.co.zw for more details).There are a number of advantages that Industrial Automation could give such as:Lower energy consumptionFaster development of productsFaster customer response and direct salesBetter process flexibilityEasier and faster methods of getting work doneThe cost of retrofitting Zimbabwean factories to becoming more automated is a challenge that can eventually be addressed by legislative incentives.This will aid the momentum of adopting industrial automation growth.While automation is slowly making its mark across the continent, its uptake is likely to be slow given the various energy challenges faced.However, it cannot be denied that Industrial Automation gives a leading edge, with competitive advantages such as faster production and cost savings.&nbsp;Eng Rujeko Masike is the chairperson of the Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Department at the Harare Institute of Technology.
